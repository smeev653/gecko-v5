 tur_tanzimat_revolution_desc: "The Sultan has fallen, and the people have finally been given their long-silenced voice. Now we need to fortify our new position. Recently a charismatic leader has risen from the cauldron of the assembly. Maybe he will be able to lead us to a brighter future." 
 tur_finance_mercantile_class_title: "Finance the Sea Routes"
 tur_finance_mercantile_class_desc: "While trade can be highly lucrative it is also a risky venture. To spread the risk merchants have often sought to spread the risks by taking on investors. Offering them a percentage of the cargo for investing into the venture. It would be wise to use some of our coffers for such investments, not only to make money, but also to strengthen the economy and incentive mercantile activities. "

 tur_shores_india_title: "Shores of India" 
 tur_shores_india_desc: "The lands of India are rich and prosperous, but many Indian rulers place restriction on the flow of trade.

 tur_land_spice_title: "Land of Spice" 
 tur_land_spice_desc: "Besides Chinese silk and ceramics, the spice trade is the most lucrative trade passing through our lands.

 #Events
 FU_Ottoman_Events.1.t: "Deposing the Knightly Scurge" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.1.d: "That the Knights of Saint John could even claim to be men of faith is a joke in and of itself. Perhaps in the days of Salah ad-Din, they may have been an honourable organization, even if still a heathen one. In recent years, however, the order has been nothing more than a gang of picaroons and reavers harassing our shipping lanes and seizing the goods of our peaceful merchants. Now that we’ve expelled this band of thieves from Rodos, however, our merchants can once again travel the seas unmolested, and denizens of our coastal settlements can sleep without fear of marauding Franks seizing their wealth. " 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.1.a: "Let our coasts be safe and prosper!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.2.t: "The High Court of Cyprus" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.2.d: "The final remnant of the Crusader States has, at last, succumbed to the sword of Islam. We have stormed the Island of Cyprus and seized the city of Nicosia from its King. The royal council, the Haute Cour, have come before us and offered their submission to our Sultan. The nobles of this council are glad to at last be free of the tyranny of their King and the overbearing influence of Italian merchants.Along with their submission, they have given us another offer; should our Sultan allow them to elect one of their own as Duke, they would aid us in ruling over the isle’s unruly Greek populace and commit their fleet to assist us in keeping order upon the seas." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.2.a: "They will serve the Sultan!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.2.b: "Eradicate the city and purge the unbelievers."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.2.c: "Let us not rush into this."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.3.t: "Victory for the House of $DYNASTY$"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.3.d: "It is beautiful; beautiful enough to bring tears to a man’s eye. Oh, I weep! I weep to see my Empire flourish so. My armies have brought all Anatolia to heel, petty Beys and the White Sheep alike brought to heel. Armenians, Kurds, and Pontic Greeks alike call me their Sultan. How the Almighty has blessed me, that I might rule lands so vast and great; that Osman Ghazi himself must look down unto me, knowing that his legacy is safe and secure in my hands. My heart flutters at the thought." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.3.a: "A day of celebration!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.4.t: "Classical Era of the Ottoman Empire"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.4.d: "My Padisah, the Classic Era of the Ottoman Empire is upon us! During this period a system of patrimonial rule based on the absolute authority of the sultan reached its apex, and the empire developed the institutional foundations which it would maintain, in modified form, for several centuries. The territory of our glorious and prestigious Empire will greatly expand, and lead to what some historians shall later called the Pax Ottomana, a few centuries later. The process of centralization undergone by the empire prior to 1453 was brought to completion in the reign of [Root.Monarch.GetName]." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.4.a: "An era of prosperity and expansion!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.5.t: "The Crusade of Varna"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.5.d: "Peace has again fallen over the Balkans with the defeat of the Christians at the Battle of Varna. Our Sultan’s dearest Father, Murad, answered his Son’s call to arms to defend us from these invaders. He has achieved a great victory, though at no small cost. Casualties at the battle were heavy on both sides, and our soldiers will need time to recover from the battering they have received. However, the Christians have come out of the fight in far worse a state, with Władysław III of Poland, Hungary, and Lithuania dead. Both Poland and Hungary find themselves in the chaos of an interregnum. Inshallah, their misfortunes will continue. Our victory has shaken Europe and Christendom to its very core, and all tremble before the might of the Sublime Ottoman State. None will dare lift a finger as we sweep our way through the Balkans. Serbia shall be ours. Wallachia will be ours. The Albanians will be brought to heel, and Skanderbeg will be killed like the dog he is. The greatest prize, also, will be ours; Constantinople." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.5.a: "The die is cast..."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.6.t: "Konstantiniyye, the Capital of the Empire"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.6.d: "Once it was the largest city in the world, but following its sacking at the hand of the Crusaders in the 13th century, the city of Constantine is a shadow of its former self. Following our capture of the city and subsequently making it the seat of our Empire; however, people from all across our lands have flocked to the city, swelling it to a size it hasn’t been in many centuries. Alongside resettling the city, this population influx has brought many men of talent; artisans, architects, and artists prime among them. With the skill of these men and the guiding hand of our Sultan, Konstantiniyye will once more be the pearl of the Mediterranean. " 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.6.a: "We are the continuation of Rome herself!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.7.t: "The Jews of Konstantiniyye"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.7.d: "Prior to our capture of Konstantiniyye from the Romans, many of the city’s Jews fled to rural Thrace or across the Bosporus to the Anatolian coast. Now that we have restored the city’s grandeur considerably, many of these Romaniote Jews have begun to flock back to the city, much to the chagrin of intolerant Christians and Muslims alike. Many of the city’s residents have called for us to prevent their return, though were we to offer them their old homes back and allow them to practice their beliefs in peace, no doubt Jews from elsewhere would begin to flock into the city, seeking the protection they are not afforded in Europe by the Christians, and bring their wealth and talents with them." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.7.a: "Allow their return."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.7.b: "We must serve our people, first."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.8.t: "Leading the Anatolian Ghazi Tribes" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.8.d: "It has now been many decades since Timur Gurkani’s rampaging through Anatolia and the subsequent civil war that erupted in our sublime state. Despite this, the cracks still show, as the petty Beys in Sinop and Karaman reign over subjects that are rightfully ours. We must rectify this situation immediately, both as a matter of pride and a matter of principle; it is unseemly that these petty despots continue to exist." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.8.a: "We will unite our brethren!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.9.t: "The Fate of the Holy City" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.9.d: "Jerusalem has been the battlefield upon which many heathens and believers have laid their lives bare in service of the divine cause of their faith. In between clashes, a significant amount of Christians makes its way to the holy sites of the City, paying respects to the various saints they look up to. As the city falls under our control, we must decide its fate, and with it, the fate of those who inhabit it regardless of religion." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.9.a: "It will become a centre of our religion once again!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.9.b: "All pilgrims must be welcome and protected by the mercy of Allah."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.10.t: "Grand Entrance in Fez!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.10.d: "The bells of the Great Mosque of Fez el-Jdid ring out into the city as Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName] arrives in the city, himself and the entire Harem-i Humayun in palanquins atop elephants, five score of the grand beasts in all. Behind this, a cavalcade of standard-bearers on camelback thirty ranks deep. The entirety of the city’s population has come to bask in the magnificence of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s procession. Following his entrance, [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be holding court in Fez for the coming weeks to ingratiate himself with his new Maghrebi subjects, with his current plan being to establish an autonomous Moroccan Pashalik due to how far-flung these territories are from Konstantiniyye. "
 FU_Ottoman_Events.10.a: "They will serve us as loyal subjects!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.10.b: "Our campaigns will take us further beyond."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.11.t: "Muslims Return in Iberia" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.11.d: "Truly, the greatness of our state continues only to reach higher and higher. Just as Tariq ibn Ziyad did centuries ago, the armies of our Sultan have crossed the Pillars of Hercules and driven the Spaniards north of the heartland of Al-Andalus, with the city of Qurtuba once again under the rule of pious Muslims. Not only do those Muslims left in Iberia rejoice at their liberation, the Sephardi Jews likewise celebrate a regime tolerant to their faith regaining control of these lands. We have achieved something that the world would have thought unthinkable even fifty years ago. "
 FU_Ottoman_Events.11.a: "Restore Al-Andalus, the rightful masters of Iberia!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.11.b: "The Iberians are next on the chopping block..."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.12.t: "Collapse of the Mamluk Sultanate" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.12.d: "To call the protection racket that the Mamluks have been running in Egypt and the Levant a state would be a generous assessment, to say the least. That their rule has lasted so long is a miracle to behold. Now, however, in our most recent round of conflict with them, the armies of our great Sultan have cut a swath of law and order through Syria and down into Egypt. Moreover, now that Kahire has fallen to our forces, the Mamluk administration has all but collapsed in their lands, and no real central government remains to oppose us in seizing the entirety of the Sultanate’s lands for ourselves. No doubt, however, our immediate seizure of all of these lands would require reliance on local powerbrokers, and the integration of the Sultanate’s lands into our administration would be a herculean feat."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.12.a: "Their lands belong to Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.12.b: "Slow and steady wins the race..."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.13.t: "The Development of Trade in Egypt" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.13.d: "Now that Egypt has been under the guiding hands of truly magnanimous rulers that have sought to invest into the land rather than simply extract taxes and tariffs as the Mamluks were want to do, the lands of the Nile Delta have once again become a prosperous region bustling with Merchants from the world over. We stand to profit significantly from the trade passing through Egypt and up to Konstantiniyye. The obvious place to focus our investments is the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. However, an ambitious engineer has come to us with another plan for investment in Egypt’s trade…"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.13.a: "Concentrate our efforts in the coast."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.13.b: "I have a better idea..."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.14.t: "New Head of Ummah"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.14.d: "Ever since Murad Hudavendigar’s conquest of Edirne in 1362, our Sultans have formally claimed the title of Caliph, the leader of the Ummah. Now that we have firm control over Kahire, however, we have managed to summon the last Abbasid Caliph, Al-Mutawakkil III, to Konstantiniyye to formally surrender the title of Caliph to Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName], giving him the sword and mantle of Muhammad. Not only is this a great position for our Sultan domestically, but it additionally affords him authority over all Muslims outside our borders, giving us greater opportunity to protect those unlucky enough to be ruled over by non-Muslims." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.14.a: "We are the defenders of our faith!"
  
 FU_Ottoman_Events.15.t: "The Rise of Kilwa Masoko"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.15.d: "Ancient Azania! The lands of the Swahili, long hindered by grievance between petty city states, and trade federations, has been unified under the banner of the Empire..We welcome our brothers of the Sunni Faith under the just stewardship of the Illustrious [Root.Monarch.GetName] and with them an indispensable point of trade between us and the far East!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.15.a: "Glory and prosperity across the city!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.16.t: "Time Claims All" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.16.d: "It has been many years since the collapse of the Mamluk Sultanate and our subsequent takeover of their lands. While their central government collapsed, local rulers maintained authority and had to be afforded a significant amount of autonomy by our Sultans. However, time’s arrow forever moves, and as the years have worn on, the previously antagonistic Mamluk aristocrats have been firmly subsumed into our administration. While they remain a distinct class from other bureaucrats and landholders, their function in our administration is identical. Our ever-growing state apparatus has slowly eroded all but their most minor privileges and autonomy." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.16.a: "The end of an era..."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.17.t: "Commercial Ventures in the East!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.17.d: "My Padisah! Our endeavors in the East have paid off. It seems your earlier investments have been a wise expenditure.. Our merchants report that we are now among the greatest trading powers along the entire Silk Road." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.17.a: "Money makes the world go 'round!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.18.t: "Myrrh Imports for the Dhimmi" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.18.d: "Much to the joy of our Dhimmi, the fruitful lands of Aden have been bestowed by Allah with a bountiful harvest of Myrrh and other sought after herbs, further enriching our already prosperous trade routes between the East, and the European continent. Truly we are blessed!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.18.a: "We will bless them with great prosperity in the name of Allah the merciful!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.19.t: "Administrating the Horn" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.19.d: "Most illustrious Padisah, \nWith the Horn Of Africa, and the lands of the so called “Ethiopian Empire” coming under our command, we are faced with a predicament as to what to do about the sizable Coptic population..By all right of law they should bow to all merciful Allah, and renounce their ways lest they be put to the sword… However, they are an ancient and even, respectable people in their own right, although they are Kaffir, it may very well suit the needs of the empire to…. Shall we say? Indulge their beliefs, at least for the time being..after all it is inevitable that all will embrace the truth of  Islam, eventually…."

 FU_Ottoman_Events.19.b: "We could learn from them, brother..."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.20.t: "The Three Court System of the Ottoman Empire"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.20.d: "As our caliphate expands and assimilates the people and cultures of its far most lands, we are faced with the question of how these non Muslim citizens of our sublime empire must be treated..  Although they do not embrace the truth of Islam and will never be held in as high esteem as our native citizenry.. we must adhere to the tenets set forth by Sharia and treat all fairly, as well as exercise just jurisprudence, lest we be no better than the barbaric Kings of Europe who prosecute our brethren with utmost prejudice. It is proposed that a judicial system of “ Three courts” be implemented to more justly address the affairs of non Muslims, and entities of economic interest." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.20.a: "The Sultanic law reigns supreme for all Ottoman subjects."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.21.t: "The Baghdad Eyalet" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.21.d: "Ancient capital of the Abbasid! Baghdad, city of law! City of the great Caliph Al-Mansur  has fallen  into the arms of the Ottoman empire, and the esteemed[Root.Monarch.GetName]  rightful and just heir to the Caliphate. Oh Noble Baghdad, long sufferer of injustice and indignity..after so many years of destitution and desecration;first at the hands of the depraved hordes of the far East, then the disgraceful Timurids, and lastly the dreadful mismanagement of the supposed “ Persian Empire”, at long last a proper steward for this most esteemed city!.. May Baghdad forever more be a shining beacon of Hanafi jurisprudence, and an inspiration to all who embody the Sunni Faith!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.21.a: "The beating heart of innovation and scholarly studies!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.22.t: "A City of Silk & Gold"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.22.d: "The Newly conquered Mazandaran lands of Tabarestan serve as a vital center of trade in our grand Empire ..With this port we have ensured that all regional trade must go through Ottoman customs as well as secured the flow of Silk and other riches from the kingdoms of the Far East, and with it, vast fortune….. Now what to do with all this gold?" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.22.a: "We must accomodate the incoming mercantile traffic from the East!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.22.b: "Order increased rewards for the soldiers, instead."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.23.t: "The Bay Toll of Hormuz" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.23.d: "With the assimilation of Hormuz into our glorious Empire, we have secured a vital choke point for trade to and from the Middle East, and Arabia…. It is true that our Caliphate grows by the day, and yet despite the profitable relationship we share with the far kingdoms, they pay us no direct tribute for the privilege.. is it not just for these non believer to pay Jizya?" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.23.a: "All your trade are belong to us!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.24.t: "Supremacy Over the Emerald Lion"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.24.d: "The Empire of Persia is vanquished and it’s vast holdings fallen under the righteous jurisprudence of our most Sublime Caliphate..Indeed, a mighty and formidable foe but even the Emerald Lion cannot stand between us and our penultimate destiny. Though much blood was shed and many a martyr born of this conquest.. the people of these lands are brothers in the faith, and deserving of respect..Indeed we shall rule justly and honor the history of this land by restoring “Persia” to its long lost glory as a valued member of our ever expanding Empire." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.24.a: "Their legacy and expertise shall serve [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.25.t: "Weaving, Gold & Silk" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.25.d: "Long the favored adornment of nobility, from ancient times, from the glorious days of Rome! Silk.. No textile is more sought after, and no empire more rich in it than ours!...So much more than mere cloth, it is a testament to wealth and power, to influence, and reverence… an object of veneration and admiration of all, peasant and noble alike… What a blessing it is that we are so positioned to benefit from trade of this material..and what a testament to the divine destiny of our Empire and our people. Just as our silken robes envelop the bodies of the worlds monarchs and adorn their great halls ..so to will our sublime radiance envelop this world." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.25.a: "We weave the fabrics of life itself."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.26.t: "Reformation of the Sipahi"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.26.d: "Fierce as they are disciplined many an infidel fallen by their sword or bow….The Tatar are indeed a formidable and skilled fighting force…. We have before us an opportunity to enlist the services of these  warriors, and in doing so greatly expand the capability of our Sipahi.. Although no doubt a boon to our fighting forces, some fear the Janissary and nobility will take offense to such arrangements." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.26.a: "Bolster the Sipahi."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.26.b: "Let's not upset the Janissaries"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.27.t: "City of the Pilgrim King" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.27.d: "AstraKhan? No, Haji Tarkhan..Pilgrimage of kings… Capital of Khazzaria. First set to proper record by the esteemed Ibn Battuta on his journey from Iberia to the Holiest site of Mecca. A land that seems itself to cry out for better stewardship than that of the disparate tribes and so called “Khans” of the Golden Horde..We have thus far maintained a beneficial if not tenuous relationship with these tribesman, however after having stymied the ambition of the perfidious Russian Empire we can no longer in good faith entertain the notion that these war chiefs who have the audacity to refer to themselves as kings are of any comparison to our most illustrious Sultan, or indeed the notion that a loose confederation of disparate tribes is any match to an Empire...Under our stewardship and the watchful eye of [Root.Monarch.GetName] AstraKhan will flourish,and the jewel of the Caspian shall shine once more." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.27.a: "The shining pearl of the Caspian Sea!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.28.t: "Travelling the Asian Trade Routes"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.28.d: "Our expansion along the silk road has been a rather fruitful endeavor.. It was most wise of you Oh great Sultan, to invest heavily in our trade routes..  In addition to troves of silk and gold….our Merchants come back with not just wild tales, but all manner of strange animals, wondrous tapestries, fine wares crafted from bone and handfuls of translucent green stones said to be highly favored by the Eastern nobles..No doubt such imports can bolster the economy of our already prosperous nation. The merchants of Kirkkilise have expressed particular interest... "
 FU_Ottoman_Events.28.a: "Such interesting and fascinating goods."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.29.t: "Christians of the Caucasus"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.29.d: "Caucasia, the final and lone holdout of Orthodox Christianity amongst the lands of Prophet Muhammad….Long standing thorn in our side and impediment to Islamic unity, has finally been brought to heel by the might of the Ottoman Empire and the divine will of  [Root.Monarch.GetName], the magnificent… What to do with these souls? While it would be prudent, the militarists, and hardliners among us say, to simply crush this bastion of insolence and bring all who will not submit,under the sword.. .The more tolerant believe it possible that we can coexist, and even reap the benefits of a friendly relationship with the population..After all, they say..are we truly so different that we cannot strive towards the veneration of the divine together?  The choice, is yours..My sultan. Shall these lands be ruled by sword or by Script? Shall our path forward be forged in blood or in brotherhood? Either way, your word, is absolute." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.29.a: "Their bones will be the foundations of our greatness!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.29.b: "No matter how astray, we are all God's children..."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.30.t: "The Coptic Orthodox Church"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.30.d: "The Coptic Church and its followers have been inhabiting the Caucasia region for centuries. Wars and famines have ravaged the region as each aspiring conqueror threw their hats in a bid to reign in the people of these mountains. However, our masterful administration has shown that the peaceful way is indeed a better alternative. As a result, our subjects in the Caucasus have begun to experience tremendous prosperity, despite our differing views on religion!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.30.a: "They shall flourish under the banner of our great empire!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.31.t: "Employing the Grenzen"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.31.d: "The lands in our northern border are trifled with much instability, famine and constant threat of incursions. Thus, it's quite difficult for our local administrators to develop that land and attract new citizens. To counter this issue we have decided to provide citizenship to the natives of those lands. The inhabitants of these areas are known as the Grenzer, or frontiersmen. They are mostly Croatian, Serbian, German, Vlach and other colonists. In exchange for land-grants, religious freedom and favorable tax rates, they shall colonize the areas and served as the bulwark for the monarchy against enemy incursions."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.31.a: "They seem useful!" 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.32.t: "Sanjak of Albania" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.32.d: "Many instances in history are full of monarchs and despots cracking the whip on their helpless subjects. In many cases this is the ideal or only solution. However, a good Sultan knows when to use the carrot and the stick. The local nobles of Albania have been reigned in effectively but who's to say they won't rise up again? Many differing opinions in the palace suggest we should ideally purge them, instead of allowing them to carry on with their local duties." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.32.a: "Sticks and stones may break their bones..." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.32.b: "...but chains and whips excite me!" 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.33.t: "Eyalets of Hungary" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.33.d: "The Carpathian border is one full of instability and rebellions. The local Hungarians still yet remember the bitter defeats their former Kingdom suffered at the hands of our Sultan. As a result, they are quite uncooperative with the current administration. Would it be wise to perhaps delegate the local administration to a semi-autonomous puppet of the former Hungarian nobility ?" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.33.a: "Delegate all the administration to one Eyalet."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.33.b: "The land belongs to the crown!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.33.c: "A Hungarian's life for me!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.34.t: "Integration of the Serbian and Wallachian Lands" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.34.d: "The introduction of new Christian lands has fostered more questions about the religious making of our Empire, as most of our Islamic subjects find themselves at home in Anatolia, rather than the Balkans. Despite cautious voices of the raising influence of the Janissaries, we can't help but delight at the sight of all these young Christian boys recruits, eager to join the ranks and serve the Empire!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.34.a: "They will flock to our standard!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.35.t: "The Crown of Rome" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.35.d: "One of the most contentious titles in the entire world's history, Rome was said to end with the fall of Constantinople in the first half of the 15th Century. Despite all the neigh-sayers who once denied us this title, we have accumulated the lands of the former Roman Empire under our grandeur and control. We can thus declare with a passion that the golden era of empires still bodes strong and rightfully, the title lies with our Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName]!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.35.a: "We are the continuation of the world's greatest Empire!" 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.36.t: "Capital of the Western World" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.36.d: "The most illustrious, the most beautiful city of Rome now lies within our grasp! Celebrations burst across our many courts as our subjects, viziers and nobles raise a glass in honour of conquering the very heart of Catholicism, the shining emblem of the white city! Henceforth we shall be the masters of all and may now bid for the crown of Rome..." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.36.a: "Their lineage is now our own!" 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.37.t: "The Collection of Byzantine Law" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.37.d: "Proper management of our lands is the basis upon which we will build an empire that will stand the test of time. To do so, Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName] collected all of the best Byzantine laws, with attention to detail and ample consideration for the Sharia, and added them into one single tome of learning and judicial understanding." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.37.a: "Knowledge begets knowledge..."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.38.t: "Millet System" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.38.d: "The newly conceived Millet System is a part of the Ottoman administration of separate religious communities that acknowledged each community’s authority in overseeing its own communal affairs, primarily through independent religious court systems and schools. This approach will assist us in holding a firm grasp on non-Muslim territories in the Balkans and beyond." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.38.a: "These communities are part of our great Empire."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.39.t: "Centralizing the Empire of Osman" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.39.d: "It is often too easy to sit back and enjoy the fruits of victory, as they tumble quickly into our mouths. However, as we tend to matters of wars with the eye of a hawk, matters of administration and internal affairs must not elude our perception, a healthy state of affairs is a healthy nation, after all. As we strive to attain centralization, most nobles and various factions at court insist that we need not press the steaming engine of centralization forward and instead let it come naturally, focusing instead of appeasing the estates themselves." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.39.a: "The future awaits!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.39.b: "Let's not rush to change the status quo..."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.40.t: "Solidifying the Ottoman Legal Code" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.40.d: "At the helm of an expanding empire, [Root.Monarch.GetName] personally instituted major judicial changes relating to society, education, taxation and criminal law. His reforms, carried out in conjunction with the empire's chief judicial official Ebussuud Efendi, harmonized the relationship between the two forms of Ottoman law, sultanic, commonly known as Kanun and religious, known as Sharia. After eliminating duplications and choosing between contradictory statements, he issued a single legal code, all the while being careful not to violate the basic laws of Islam. It was within this framework that  [Root.Monarch.GetName], supported by his Grand Mufti Ebussuud, sought to reform the legislation to adapt to a rapidly changing Empire. When the Kanun laws attained their final form, the code of laws became known as the Kanun-i Osmani, or the 'Ottoman laws'.  [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s legal code was to last more than three hundred years." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.40.a: "Expand the powers of the Parliament!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.40.b: "Delegate important duties to capable administrators!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.40.c: "Concentrate absolute power in the hands of the Sultan!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.41.t: "The Mansure Reforms" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.41.d: "Centuries of infighting and corruption have led to the Janissaries experiencing decadence, content with increased influence and meddling in the Sultanic affairs, they have become brazen and forgot who their allegiance lies with. Our recent attempts to reform the army and improve the current situation has not gone unnoticed, sadly. Janissary officers have gathered behind some of our generals, demanding we not only cease the reforms but to also abdicate the throne to their form of government with a puppet in the Ottoman Throne. Should we not comply, they intimidate that the entire country will be destabilized and they will take up arms to defend their centuries-old rights!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.41.a: "We must reform at any cost!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.41.b: "Bow down to Janissary influence."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.42.t: "Moriscos Arrive from Granada" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.42.d: "Sultan [Root.Monarch.GetName] sent out proclamations throughout the empire that the refugees were to be welcomed. He granted them the permission to settle in the Ottoman Empire and become Ottoman citizens. He ridiculed the conduct of the monarchs of Castile and Aragon in expelling a class of people so useful to their subjects. 'You venture to call Ferdinand a wise ruler,' he said to his courtiers — 'he who has impoverished his own country and enriched mine!' [Root.Monarch.GetName] addressed a firman to all the governors of his European provinces, ordering them not only to refrain from repelling the Spanish refugees, but to give them a friendly and welcome reception. He threatened with death all those who treated the Moriscos harshly or refused them admission into the empire." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.42.a: "They are most welcome." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.42.b: "We cannot risk angering the Iberian monarchs."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.43.t: "The Art of Cartography of Piri Reis"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.43.d: "Piri began engaging in government-supported privateering, a common practice in the Mediterranean Sea among both the Muslim and Christian states of the 15th and 16th centuries, when he was young, following his uncle Kemal Reis, a well-known corsair and seafarer of the time, who later became a famous admiral of the Ottoman Navy. During this period, together with his uncle, he took part in many naval wars of the Ottoman Empire against Spain, the Republic of Genoa and the Republic of Venice, including the First Battle of Lepanto in 1499 and the Second Battle of Lepanto (Battle of Modon) in 1500. When his uncle Kemal Reis died in 1511, his ship was wrecked by a storm in the Mediterranean Sea, while he was heading to Egypt, Piri returned to Gelibolu, where he started working on his studies about navigation.  \n\nIn 1547, Piri had risen to the rank of Reis, commonly known as admiral, as the Commander of the Ottoman Fleet in the Indian Ocean and Admiral of the Fleet in Egypt, headquartered in Suez. During that time, he authored of the Kitab-i Bahriye, or Book of the Sea, one of the most famous cartographical works of the period. The book gives seafarers information on the Mediterranean coast, islands, crossings, straits, and gulfs as well as where to take refuge in the event of a storm, how to approach the ports, and precise routes to the ports. The work was first published in 1521, and it was revised in 1524-1525 with additional information and better-crafted charts in order to be presented as a gift to Sultan Suleiman I. The revised edition had a total of 434 pages containing 290 maps." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.43.a: "We must employ him!" 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.51.t: "Rebellions in the Balkans" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.51.d: "The Janissary rebels seem to be gathering en masse across our Balkan territories. Like hungry wolves they take up arms against the Sultan in a vile attempt to usurp the crown that was so rightfully given to him by God Himself!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.51.a: "Get me my whip!" 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.52.t: "Rebellions in the Anatolian Territories"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.52.d: "The Janissary rebels seem to be gathering en masse across our Anatolian territories. Like hungry wolves they take up arms against the Sultan in a vile attempt to usurp the crown that was so rightfully given to him by God Himself!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.52.a: "By Allah they shall have a taste of my boot!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.53.t: "Janissary Defections" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.53.d: "My Sultan! It appears that many soldiers in our grand army have decided to defect and travel our lands to either escape the impending mayhem or join the rebel scum! We must separate the wheat from the chaff but it appears that doing so has left our army wholly unprepared for the oncoming troubles. A black day for our history books!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.53.a: "Bah, we will make a new army! With cannons and rifles!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.53.b: "We have to secure the remaining army's loyalty." 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.54.t: "End of the Janissary Rebellions" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.54.d: "We have weathered the storm! After years of brutal combat across the entirety of our Empire, the Janissary rebels have been thoroughly massacred! It is no secret that none of them will rebel, if those who wanted to have been experly wiped out. This moment was dreamt by our predecessors for centuries, yearning to rid the country of the Janissaries' influence. We can now re-militarize our nation and westernize our troops!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.54.a: "Finally, a clear sky!" 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.55.t: "Rocket Man" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.55.d: "O my sultan! Be blessed, I am going to talk to Jesus! Those are the words that Legari Hasan Celebi spoke to [Root.Monarch.GetName] as he was about to take off in what seemed to be a quirky and weird mechanical contraption full of chemicals and gunpowder. Who's to say these days with all these new trends that our people engage in. So long as he's wearing protective kneepads!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.55.a: "Ground control to Major Celebi!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.55.b: "Away with you, vile beggar!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.56.t: "The Guns of Urban" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.56.d: " One of the most influential siege specialists of the 15th century, Urban initially offered his services to the Byzantine Emperor. However, due to lack of imperial funds for his salary, they were thankfully unable to keep him in the court. As a sign of spite, he has made an astute appearence in our stairs, asking to be employed and promising that his siege machines will bring the strongest walls down in a dramatic fashion."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.56.a: "Surely employing him is a balanced decision!" 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.57.t: "Janissaries Demand Privileges" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.57.d: "Disgruntled Janissaries have made their way to the Sultan's private chamber. With their hands on their swords they demand their fair share of royal privileges, just like the other Estates enjoy theirs. According to their written declaration it is inconcievable that the Sultan's most decorated armed forces are made to feel lesser to petty nobles and merchants!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.57.a: "We must accept..."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.57.b: "Never!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.58.t: "Surgun Flock to [151.GetName]" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.58.d: "With our grand campaign in the Balkans commencing with the conquest of Constantinople, we have begun to see a surge in migration from nearby towns and villages into the city. These people, called the Surgun have moved to Constantinople to uplift their standard of living and livelihoods. Not only would this result in increased standard of living and income for the migrants, the grand city itself would benefit from the extra workforce and labour. May the Almighty bless us with such days of prosperity constantly!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.58.a: "They are most welcome!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.59.t: "Dhimmi Religions Thrive in [151.GetName]" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.59.d: "The immense development project in Constantinople has at last, begun to bear fruit. Over the years, many religious minorities like the Jews, among many others have migrated to the City of the World's Desire. These minorities have set up their own communities within the city and have begun to intermingle with other religious communities. Many of these communities have begun to thrive within Constantinople, earning enough to sustain themselves and their families. Rarely has any other nation shown as much tolerance for other religions as compared to us, and that is the reason why the city of Constantinople is going through its mini–Golden Era." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.59.a: "All shall prosper under our banner!" 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.60.t: "Qizilbash Rebellions" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.60.d: "The Qizilbash were Turkoman-Sh'ia militant groups that flourished immensely in the eastern part of the Anatolian Peninsula during the late 15th century. These figures played an important role in the consolidation of Persia by the Safavids. In 1512, the Safavids began with their da'wah within the Ottoman Empire and the conversion of Eastern Turkoman Tribes, who ended up joining the Safavid Ranks. As a result of this, the Shi'ite Turks living in Asia Minor were beginning to get deported into the region of Morea. The Safavid Qizilbash made their way into Kurdistan, defeating the local Turkish Garrisons while being heavily outnumbered. Now, the Ottoman Empire is treading a cross-road, between complete defeat and humiliation and ultimate and everlasting victory!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.60.a: "Grand Vizier, get my whip!" 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.61.t: "Sahkulu Rebellions" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.61.d: "The 1510s were turbulent times within the Ottoman Empire. Safavid Missionaries and Qizilbash Militants ran rampant in the eastern parts of the Empire. In 1511, the Turkoman Qizilbash rallied under the cause of Shahkulu, the son of the halife of Teke. He has been a thorn in our sides for a long time, and he dared to raid our grand caravans in the east. Our Empire has no place for such rabid and vile creatures, let us now raise the banner of the prophet and crush these animals once and for all." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.61.a: "Damn these Shiites!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.62.t: "The Tomb of Abu Hanifa" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.62.d: "Imam Abu Hanifa was a Sunni Muslim Theologian and jurist born in Greater Khorasan, Persia. Widely credited as the founder of the Hanifa School of thought, his body was forever cherished in a mosque in Baghdad. Now, with our recent conquest of the grand city, it is up to the decision of the Sultan whether to restore the Tomb of Hanifa or to save the ducats so that they could be allocated elsewhere." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.62.a: "Restore his tomb and honor his legacy!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.62.b: "Our coin is best spent elsewhere!" 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.63.t: "Poor Economic Policies of [Root.Monarch.GetName]" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.63.d: "It seems as though the poor economic policies of the Sultan have shown their ugly colors. The Ottoman economy has collapsed overnight. The collapse has resulted in hyperinflation and more general unrest across the borders of the empire. It will take many months before we could recover from this tragedy." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.63.a: "Mint EVERYTHING!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.64.t: "The Siyer-i Nebi"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.64.d: "Completed in 1338 by the Mustafa of Erzurum, Al Darir on the demand of Sultan Berkuk, it is an epic depicting the journey of the Prophet Muhammand. Murad III had ordered the complete visual depiction of the epic, and was undertaken by the calligrapher Lufti Abdullah. This record was described as "the largest single cycle of religious painting in Islamic art" by contemporaries. It consists of 814 miniatures which are expertly depicted. It is very different than compared to other Islamic Caricatures and remains a prideful possession of the Sultan. Forever shall glory hail on the Ottoman Empire!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.64.a: "A celebrated literature for the Great Prophet!" 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.65.t: "Islamic Epistemology in [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Era"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.65.d: "Epistemology. The word itself is as mystic as the meaning behind it. The theory of knowledge on anything is referred to as its epistemology. With our Sultan favoring more and more Islamic Philosophers, they have been focusing more and more on understanding the philosophy behind Islam. This will surely lead to everlasting glory for the Ulema of the Ottomans due to the never-ending patronage of the Sultan!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.65.a: "An era of learning and philosophy!" 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.66.t: "Suleiman the Magnificent"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.66.d: "Born as the son of Sultan Selim I and Hafsa Sultan, a Muslim convert, Suleiman has shown such exceptional talent that was rarely seen in Ottoman Sultans at the time. He was a well learned man, and was taught Islamic Literature from a very young age. He also took interests in subjects that most young men would be repulsed from like science, history, literature and military tactics. If he is designated as the heir to the Empire, many are sure that the Empire would achieve its greatest."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.66.a: "The crown of the prince is his!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.66.b: "No cutting in line, little Suleiman!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.67.t: "Janissaries Demand Reinstation of Privileges" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.67.d: "After our recent feud with the janissaries, many of the Janissaries have grown discontent with the Sultan’s policies. They demand the reinstation of privileges that have been snatched away from them and they also demand greater autonomy. Whilst this will please the Janissaries, it may lead to the Sultan’s reputation getting tarnished and being called a coward. On the other hand, if we refuse these privileges to the Janissaries, it may deepen their discontentment further, and may lead to an open rebellion. We must consider all options, and decide our next step carefully. " 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.67.a: "So be it." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.67.b: "Talk to the hand."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.68.t: "Safeguarding the Line of Succession" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.68.d: "Our Current Vali Ahad is the one who we deem the most appropriate to rule our Empire. He however, has many brothers. These Brothers envy his position as the heir and also hold positions of authority within the Empire. These incompetent fools may try to rise up when our Vali Ahad takes the throne and try to disrupt his rule. Therefore, it is best that we get rid off these jackals while we have our time. However, doing this may have some unforeseen consequences in the future. We shall consider this choice carefully."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.68.a: "We only need ONE Vali Ahad!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.68.b: "Let us not risk an open rebellion..."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.68.c: "Blood is thicker than water, brother." 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.69.t: "A Heart Once Broken" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.69.d: "Oh, how innocent was his smile. How he reached me with questions regarding the Empire. “Father!” he would say. “Father, how large is the Holy Land?” He asked me once. I remembered laughing with him as we swallowed fruits. I thought… that what I did for him was for the better. Apparently, I was wrong. Hearing the news of his brothers’ untimely demise, my healthy, steadfast prince fell ill, very ill and now, he lays in an eternal slumber… right in front of me. I want to see his face for the last time, but I can’t. Forever, will the guilt engulf me. In my sleep, I will remember the faces of my other sons whom I mercilessly murdered, and I can no longer face my wife or my concubines. All that exists now, is guilt and shame." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.69.a: "My boy, my poor boy..." 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.70.t: "A Letter from the Queen-Mother"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.70.d: "“My Sultan and Son” the letter said. “It has been quite some time since I last saw you. I know that you live a busy life in Constantinople now.” It continued. “It would be my greatest pleasure, as a mother, if you could come and spend some time with me.” Tears fill my eyes, how long it has been since I last saw her. “I have gone through painstakingly long nine months before I gave birth to my pride. I know that it’s quite sudden. But it would be quite the joyful experience if I could spend time with you again.” I put the letter down and ponder. I miss her and really want to see her, but is leaving the duties of the Sultan justified for meeting family?"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.70.a: "I have missed you, mother."
 FU_Ottoman_Events.70.b: "The affairs of state wait for no man!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.71.t: "Kira and Strongilah" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.71.d: "Strongilah is unlike any women seen in the Harem. She was a daughter of a Karaite Jew from Crimea. She was the first Kira in Harem and acted as a go-between for luxury goods as well as medicines. She eventually consolidated a lot of power in the Harem of Selim I and became the favorite of Hafsa Sultan. She was eventually allowed to own slaves and was exempted from paying taxes as per the request of Hafsa Sultan. Some members of the Harem and administration despise the extra power she has been given and demands reduction of her power. Who shall the Sultan favor in this case?" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.71.a: "She will serve us finely." 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.71.b: "The estate does not need the input of a harem member."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.72.t: "Family First"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.72.d: "Today, I met with my mother. Has she really gotten this old since I last saw her? It was my duty, as a son, above that of a Sultan to meet her, and to spend time with her. The time spent with her felt like two seconds, even though it was two hours for the courtiers. It was quite refreshing, walking down the floors of the palace along with her by my side. I shared stories from my side, and she shared stories from hers, many of which seemed to amuse me. Perhaps, If I weren’t the Sultan, I would have spent my days like this, but oh well, I can ponder about that some other time" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.72.a: "It's good to see you, mother!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.73.t: "Reign of Women" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.73.d: "During the Seljuk Reign over Anatolia, the female nobility held immense power in matters of policies and affairs. This however, began to decline with the emergence of the ‘lead from the horse’ doctrine. Earlier Ottoman policies included granting governorships to princes and their mothers, due to which they would not be able to challenge the true heir. All of this changed with the turn of the 16th century. This saw the reign of Sultan Suleiman I, and with that reign came several changes, one of which was the integration of the Imperial Harem into the palace. These changes made the mothers and wives of the Sultan have almost unlimited power in the matters of administration and diplomacy. This ‘Sultanate of Women’ led to immense growth of public works, facilities and defense. This reign saw immense criticism from men within the Empire, like viziers and advisors. Thus, a question arose. Is giving immense power to the women within the harem worth it?" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.73.a: "They shall be the right hand of the Sultan!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.73.b: "We cannot divide royal power."
 
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.74.t: "Testing the Limits of Royal Power" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.74.d: "It seems as though the ‘Sultanate of Women’ policy has come to bite us in the back. The Legal Mother of the Sultan has been testing the limits of royal power that had been generously given to them by the Sultan. These foolish women of the Sultanate have been meddling with royal affairs as well, which we simply could not let slide. However, the Sultan still favors her mother, citing that it is her legal right, as the mother of the Sultan to advise him on matters of legislation and administration. What should be done concerning the power of the Women?"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.74.a: "It is well within her right!" 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.74.b: "Her excesses need to be curbed."
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.75.t: "Hayreddin Barbarossa"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.75.d: "Also known as Hizir Hayrettin Pasha, and simply Hizir Reis, was an Ottoman corsair and later admiral of the Ottoman Navy. Barbarossa's naval victories secured Ottoman dominance over the Mediterranean during the mid 16th century. Born on Lesbos, Khizr began his naval career as a corsair under his elder brother Oruç Reis. In 1516, the brothers captured Algiers from Spain, with Oruç declaring himself as Sultan. Following Oruç's death in 1518, Khizr inherited his brother's nickname, Barbarossa, Redbeard in Italian. He also received the honorary name Hayreddin. In 1529, Barbarossa retook the Penon of Algiers from the Spaniards. In 1533, Barbarossa was appointed Kapudan Pasha (Grand admiral) of the Ottoman Navy by Suleiman the Magnificent. He led an embassy to France in the same year, conquered Tunis in 1534, achieved a decisive victory over the Holy League at Preveza in 1538, and conducted joint campaigns with the French in the 1540s. Barbarossa retired to Constantinople in 1545 and died the following year. Such a resourceful admiral will surely serve us well!"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.75.a: "He will make a fine admiral!"
 
 FU_Ottoman_Events.77.t: "This is Literally 1984 I can't believe you did this"
 FU_Ottoman_Events.77.d: "the developer of this mod is a complete child, i was banned from the discord server because he didnt like the way i type, sure the mod is good but the person who develops it acts like a complete child. im gonna have to not play it due to that, i dont want to support someone who bans people who have been playing their mod since the begining for not liking the way they type."
