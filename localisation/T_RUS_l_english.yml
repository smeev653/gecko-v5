They know only strength, weakness now would be fatal!"

Many Tatars, despite being enraged by the conquest of their lands, have accepted the Tsar's right to rule at least begrudingly.

    henri_rus_larp.2.d:0 "While technically a part of the Muscovite realm, the wilds of Vyatka's allegiance is far from strong. They refuse to pay taxes, and cooperate with the Knayz's policies. Udmurt influence runs deep in the region, with Orthodoxy often only skin deep and the church weak. Constant violence between the Vyatkan's and their Udmurt allies and the towns of Volgoda threatens to put the entire region in peril. They even seek to strike bargains with the Khanate of Kazan! We will have to deal with them, or face the consequences."

    henri_rus_larp.3.t:0 "The Steppe Horror"
    henri_rus_larp.3.d:0 "The borderlands suffer horribly at the hands of the Great Horde, Kazani, Crimean and Nogai war bands. Mothers watch as their sons are crushed to death, their husbands slaughtered, their daughters carted off to satisfy the cruel desires of a heartless people. To say the Rus of the border regions suffer horribly, is the greatest understatement. Only the end of the Tatar yoke, and the liberation of the slaves held by them will end this terror. "

Expanding the power and role of the Tatar nobles, by giving them power in Muscovy and other Rus lands, will increase the power of the state at the expense of the Rus nobility. The Tatar nobles will be extremely loyal to the Tsar, as they will know to whom they owe their allegiance and that the Rus nobles wish nothing more than to take their powers for themselves."

    henri_rus_larp.8.d:0 "Astonished locals have reported a large British ship outside of Arkhangelsk.

    henri_rus_larp.9.d:0 "Since the intitial expansion of the Rus into Muscovy, we have encountered and assimilated many different Chude tribes. The recent conquest of Udmurt, Permian and other Chude lands in the distant forests has been substantially harder to integrate than the previous groups we assimilated. We may have to be more tolerant of their practices and customs."
    henri_rus_larp.9.a:0 "Allow them to practice their customs and traditions, and synergize them with those of the Rus"

We must expand our winter training and train our troops further to maximise on this advantage!"

The nobility of the land are primarily Baltic Germans, deeply hated by the native population but who have many links to Germany and have important skill sets that may be useful. Should we assimilate them or deprive them of their land?"
    henri_rus_larp.15.a:0 "Integrate the German nobility and provide them with prestigous positions"
    henri_rus_larp.15.b:0 "A German can never have a true Russian soul. Confiscate their estates and give them to Orthodox Russians!"

    henri_rus_larp.16.t:0 "Lack of Ports"
    henri_rus_larp.16.d:0 "The critical lack of ports has deeply hurt our trade and import of technology. Until we can open up trade networks to the West, the blockade will hurt us! We have been forced to rely on the strength of our people and boyars in lieu of this chronic situation"
