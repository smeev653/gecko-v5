 the_tupchi:0 "The Tupchiyan"
 the_tupchi_desc:0 "Abbas has ordered the creation of an artillery corps, integrating the use of massed cannon into our newly reformed armies. Our use of combined firearms will ensure victory."
 the_tofangchi:0 "Establish the Tufangchiyan"
 the_tofangchi_desc:0 "Following a series of defeats, it is becoming evermore clear that our armies of Turkoman tribal supporters are struggling to keep pace on the battlefield with organized foot soldiers bearing firearms. We must learn from these defeats, and as such we will found our own corps of musketeers which will be outfitted with sophisticated firearms to handle any threat to our kingdom."

 promotion_of_irrigation_desc:0 "If we encourage agriculture, we will increase our population so we will have more manpower for our army."

 humbaraci_corps:0 "Establish the Humbaraci Corps"
 humbaraci_corps_desc:0 "The Humbaraci Ocagi were in charge of the manufacturing, transportation, and use of cannons. The Ottoman army later established a workshop to cast humbaras in order to give the fire power of the artillery to the mobilized infantry groups."

 arb_1:0 "Indian Ocean Trade"
 arb_1_desc:0 "Our sailors have been to the Swahili coasts and as far as Hindustan and even the Malay lands. We can play a critical role in the flow of goods between these wealthy regions."
 arb_2:0 "Arabian Horsemanship"
 arb_2_desc:0 "The man who rides for pleasure or military occupation has no idea what true horsemanship is. The Bedouin rides to trade, to eat, to live. It should surprise no one that, in addition to the finest horses, Arabia produces the finest cavalrymen."
 arb_3:0 "Bedouin Raiders"
 arb_3_desc:0 "Since before the days of the Prophet, Bedouins have been experts at the art of the raid. An army may march on its stomach, but it won't march far when our raiders take the food right out of the army's mouth through rapid hit and run seizures of their supply lines. Pull back and let the raiders do their work and watch as the invader dies of thirst."
 arb_4:0 "Spreading the Prophet's Word"
 arb_4_desc:0 "There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is His messenger. By now, all men should know these holy words, but a shocking amount still dwell in the pitiable state of ignorance of Islam. Our missionaries are ready to spread the words of the Prophet."
 arb_5:0 "Unite the Tribes"
 arb_5_desc:0 "Our loosely-organized way of handling our affairs has its upsides. Perhaps we could allow the tribes to continue providing for the upkeep of their own soldiers and horsemen while bringing them together in a more modern military pointed outwards rather than within?"
 arb_6:0 "Bedouin Traders"
 arb_6_desc:0 "There aren't many sharply-delineated man-made borders in Arabia, and even if there were, the Bedouin would ignore them. Though the Bedouin nomadic journeys through our lands and into others has risks, it also facilitates easy access to trade through the entire region, as Bedouin nomads know no import tariffs or trade embargoes."
 arb_7:0 "Arabia"
 arb_7_desc:0 "Although Arabia has many different clans, tribes and countries, all share in the use of the Arabic language, it forms the unifying feature of all Arabs. Under a strong leadership we can unite all Arabian lands under a single flag and one ruler."

 #persia#
 persian_theocracy:0 "Persian Theocracy"
 persian_theocracy_desc:0 "After declaring our lands to be a bastion of Shi'ism, we must now launch a vigorous campaign to convert those who would oppose the true faith, ridding our kingdom of the Sunni population by either persuasion or force. Political and religious power will remain completely intertwined, and encapsulated in the person of the Shah."
 establish_qurchi_corps_reform:0 "Establish Qurchi Corps"
 establish_qurchi_corps_reform_desc:0 "The Qizilbash tribes are the core of our military strength, and their nobles already occupy the Office of the Sepahsalar. If we trust them to protect our kingdom, we should extend this trust to ourselves by establishing a permanent royal guard. Naturally, the newly created Office of the Qurchi-bashi will also need to be filled. Who better to command our royal guard than the same nobles who have led our armies?"
 foreign_ghilman_reform:0 "Enlist Ghilman"
 foreign_ghilman_reform_desc:0 "As we conquer deeper into the Caucasus, our lands have become full of Christian tribes and clans that we could put to good use if we gave them a place within our system of state. Their people consist of tough warriors and innovative thinkers. If we can convert them from their heathen ways, they could make excellent advisors, military officers, and act as local representatives. Most of all they could mobilize their kinsmen and provice us with a source of elite soldiers who could counter the immense influence of the Qizilbash in our armies and military command."
 qizilbash_in_officer_corps_reform:0 "Qizilbash Officer Corps Influence"
 qizilbash_in_officer_corps_reform_desc:0 "With the important military administrative position of the Office of the Qullar-bashi firmly in control of the Ghilman, the jealous Qizilbash have pushed for control of the Office of the Tupchi-bashi and the Office of the Tufangchi-bashi, commanders of our musketeer and artillery corps respectively. With the Qizilbash already having such power, it would be wise to appease them... for now."
 reforms_of_abbas_i_reform:0 "Reforms of Abbas I"
 reforms_of_abbas_i_reform_desc:0 "Far too much power has been concentrated by the Qizilbash tribes, and we have become far too reliant on them for our military might. It is time to restructure the army. We should bolster our military with a greater emphasis on artillery and firearms, and shift the backbone of our armies from the untrustworthy Turkoman tribes to the Ghilman, who have become solely loyal to us.\n\nBeyond this, as our kingdom grows our lands have become home to many Christians. Despite our tradition of zealotry, it would be wise to show tolerance for their practices, if only to further integrate them and quell any spark of rebellion.\n\nHowever, it is not only the army and bureaucracy that need change, but our kingdom's economy as well. We will foster our diminishing trade back to health by reestablishing the security of our roads so that caravans may travel our lands unmolested."
 ghilman_administrative_positions_reform:0 "Ghilman Administrative Positions"
 ghilman_administrative_positions_reform_desc:0 "Over time it has become evermore clear that we cannot trust our conflict prone Qizilbash commanders and administrators. If we are to acquire officials we can trust we must look to recruit elite slaves to fill these positions instead."

 upgrade_janissary_weaponry_reform:0 "Upgrade Janissary Weaponry"
 upgrade_janissary_weaponry_reform_desc:0 "During the initial period of formation, Janissaries were expert archers, but they began adopting firearms as soon as they became available."
 derbend_organization_reform:0 "Derbend Organization"
 derbend_organization_reform_desc:0 "Derbendjis were the most important and largest Ottoman military auxiliary constabulary units usually responsible for guarding important roads, bridges, fords or mountain passes. Usually, the population of an entire village near some important pass would be assigned with Derbendji status in exchange for tax exemptions. By rehabilitating the Derbendjis, the Ottomans released conventional military units from routine internal duties, such as guarding and repairing roads and bridges."
 establish_auxiliary_support_system_reform:0 "Establish Auxiliary Support System"
 establish_auxiliary_support_system_reform_desc:0 "The Ottoman armies were distinguished from their contemporaries not just by the numerical predominance of its military forces but by the thoroughness of the administrative backup and general support that maintained them in the field. The Ottoman army had a corps to prepare the road, a corps to pitch the tents ahead, a corps to bake the bread. The Djebedji Corps, a subunit of the Ottoman artillery corps, functioned as part of the Janissaries, who also maintained its own medical auxiliaries."
 reform_the_janissaries_reform:0 "Reform the Janissary Corps"
 reform_the_janissaries_reform_desc:0 "Despite an early adoption of firearm technology, the Janissaries have become increasingly resistant to changes, often rising in rebellion when feeling threatened by outside influence, leaving our infantry in a weakened state as Western nations modernize their militaries. We must enforce a change and reorganize the Janissary Corps, or risk falling indefinitely behind our rivals."
 janissary_administrative_positions_reform:0 "Janissary Administrative Positions"
 janissary_administrative_positions_reform_desc:0 "Likely a product of the disciplined lifestyle that is standard to the Janissaries, many have become well-educated members of the askeri class, whose talents would be better served as administrators and scholars than soldiers... for a price."
