 per_a_sons_revenge_title: "A Son's Revenge"
 per_a_sons_revenge_desc: "Our shaikh has been martyred at the hands of the accursed Shirvanshah. Qizilbash - to arms! We must avenge the son of our dynasty and raise a magnificent khanqah over the smoldering ruins of Baku if we are to conquer the Caucasus and unify Iran." 
 per_subjugate_the_caucasus_kingdoms_title: "Subjugate the Caucasus"
 per_subjugate_the_caucasus_kingdoms_desc: "Now that Ottoman ambitions threaten our rule over the Caucasus, the time has come to protect the Georgians. Doing so would secure a valuable source of soldiers, bureaucrats, and noble daughters should we choose to embrace them, and as the qizilbash become increasingly powerful, they may prove to be a valuable counterweight to their zealous excess." 
 per_cross_the_mountains_title: "Cross the Mountains"
 per_cross_the_mountains_desc: "Beyond the Caucasus lie the mountains of Dagestan, the forests of Circassia, and the steppes of the Taman Peninsula. The people of this land are fierce fighters who would make excellent additions to the ranks of the qizilbash. Furthermore, while the sons of our esteemed dynasty have traditionally been born of Turkmen mothers, the noble daughters of the Circassian tribes would do well to marry into our house."
 per_gateway_india_title: "Gateway to India"
 per_gateway_india_desc: "The unruly Pashtun and Baloch tribes of eastern Khorasan have been a continual thorn in our side since the founding of our dynasty. Securing their cooperation presents the opportunity to take advantage of their important role in northeast Hindustan's military labor market to cross the Khyber Pass toward the rich plains of Punjab."
 per_hindus_river_title: "The Indus River" 
 per_hindus_river_desc: "The mighty Indus flows through the great cities of Sindh and Punjab. This is a land of thriving cities, bustling markets, fertile farmlands, and hundreds of Sufi saints, holy men, and religious orders. Bringing it under our rule will let these orders blossom under our protection as we harness the region's incredible wealth." 
 per_break_bhadra_fort_title: "Break the Bhadra Fort"
 per_break_bhadra_fort_desc: "To the east of Sindh lie the cosmopolitan ports of the Gujarat Sultanate. While the Muzaffarids have effectively reaped the rewards of the fabulous wealth flowing through the cities of Surat, Khambhat, and Ahmedabad, the recent assassination of their sultan has left their land ripe for the taking. Let us strike while the iron is hot, scale the Bhadra Fort, and defeat the Gujaratis once and for all!" 
 per_gurjarabhumi_title: "Unite Western India"
 per_gurjarabhumi_desc: "The fractured states of Gujarat, Rajputana, and the Malwa Plateau stubbornly resist our rule. We must bring them into the fold so that they may prosper under our benevolent stewardship." 
 per_master_of_india_title: "Master of India" 
 per_master_of_india_desc: "In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful, our esteemed dynasty has done what the Timurid, Sayyid, Lodi, and Sur dynasties failed to do and become the undisputed masters of Hindustan! The lion and sun flies over Delhi and prayers are said in the name of our shah in mosques across the land. We alone have conquered the unconquerable. While the question of how our state will integrate itself into Hindustan's cultural fabric remains, it is clear that we will go down in history as one of its greatest empires."
 per_sponsor_madrasas_title: "Sponsor Madrasas" 
 per_sponsor_madrasas_desc: "Madrasas are educational institutions in which students learn math, science, theology, ethics, and metaphysics. Madrasas include living quarters, lecture rooms, and a prayer hall laid out along a conventional four-iwan courtyard plan. Continuing the Timurids' support of these distinguished religious institutions will grant our state a steady supply of highly educated clerics, bureaucrats, and administrators." 
 per_the_persian_administration_title: "Persian Administration"
 per_the_persian_administration_desc: "The effectiveness of our state is marred by constant power struggles between the Turkmen qizilbash who form the core of our army and the Persian notables who fill the ranks of our bureaucracy and religious establishment. As the qizilbash become ever bolder in their efforts to subvert our authority, we must embolden the Persians by appointing one of their own as the Shah's wakil (viceregent) in religious and administrative affairs." 
 per_reform_first_pillar_title: "Reform the First Pillar" 
 per_reform_first_pillar_desc: "Our shah is under the protection of the qurchi bodyguard corps. Led by the powerful qurchi-bashi, the qurchis are recruited from the principal qizilbash tribes and are paid by the royal treasury. Despite their origins among the qizilbash, their personal loyalty to our dynasty distinguishes them from the tribes and empowering them by swelling their ranks and appointing their most capable commanders as governors and bureaucrats may tighten our grip on the state at the expense of the qizilbash." 
 per_gunpowder_empire_title: "Gunpowder Empire" 
 per_gunpowder_empire_desc: "The increasing importance of gunpowder weapons in warfare has prompted our shah to establish the tofangchi musket and tupchi artillery corps. Equipped with modern weapons, these soldiers have successfully adapted the use of firearms to the swift and flexible maneuvering typical of traditional Iranian tactics. The invention of the zamburak, a mobile swivel gun mounted on the backs of camels, has further eased the integration of firearms into an army suited to fighting in the steep mountain passes of the Zagros." 
 per_commemorate_arbadeen_title: "Commemorate Arba'een"
 per_commemorate_arbadeen_desc: "Arba’een commemorates the end of the forty-day mourning period after Ashura, the day on which the venerable Hazrat Husayn, son of Hazrat Ali and grandson of the Prophet Muhammad was tragically martyred at Karbala. As we honor his martyrdom, we must remember the words of the Sixth Imam in our commitment to liberate the masses from the yoke of ignorance. Let us harness the popular piety of the people by building mosques, renovating shrines, performing pilgrimages, and reaffirming our role as the Twelfth Imam’s sole representative on earth during the Major Occultation." 
 per_enlarge_blue_mosque_title: "Embellish the Blue Mosque"
 per_enlarge_blue_mosque_desc: "The great Turkmen padishah Shah Jahan Qara Qoyunlu graced the imperial city of Tabriz with a magnificent mosque whose expansive dome and elegant solution to the ever-present structural problem of reconciling light and space is sure to inspire generations of future architects. Let us honor this masterpiece by embellishing it with the artistic expertise of our own dynasty."
 per_heavenly_devotion_title: "Heavenly Devotion" 
 per_heavenly_devotion_desc: "Our dynasty has risen from a small Sufi order in the mountains of Azerbaijan to the primary protectors of the Muslim world. While we have traditionally encouraged manifestations of popular piety such as tasawwuf, saint veneration, shrine worship, pilgrimage, and devotion to Hazrat Ali and the ahl al-bayt, the immense spiritual authority we have accrued has granted us the golden opportunity to decide the direction in which we will steer the religious affairs of our state." 
 per_rekindle_the_flames_title: "To Rekindle the Flames"
 per_rekindle_the_flames_desc: "Our great land was once lit with the flickering flames of the holy fires that graced the temples of our ancestors. Burning ever so bright with its brilliant purity, fire reminds us of the glory of Hormazd and the sacred truth revealed by the Prophet Zartosht so many centuries ago. Let us cherish the holy fires that survive and inaugurate a new era for our faith by building magnificent temples across Iran!" 
 per_restore_mobeds_title: "Restore the Mobeds"
 per_restore_mobeds_desc: "The time has come to enlist the aid of our Parsi brothers in Hindustan in rebuilding the priestly mobed class that attends to our holy fires. We will need to teach our priests to preserve the Avesta, organize our religious festivals, purify the dadgah and adaran fires during Adar Mah, and perform the Yasna ceremony vital to the defense of Hormazd in his cosmic struggle against chaos and destruction." 
 per_path_to_kingship_title: "Path to Kingship" 
 per_path_to_kingship_desc: "Temples have been built, rites have been performed, mobeds have been trained, and we have diligently followed our directives to find common cause with our Muslim subjects to lead them down the path of enlightenment. Our fostering of a new religious synthesis has led to the rise of various syncretic sects that have fused our respective religious traditions, guiding the ignorant toward the one true faith. We have cemented our place as the rightful rulers of Iran, heralding a new age for our resurgent faith." 
 per_conquer_armenian_cities_title: "Secure Armenia"
 per_conquer_armenian_cities_desc: "The Armenians are a proud but divided people, and exploiting these divisions to bring them under our rule would secure the eastern Caucasus. While ripe for conversion, the Christians are skilled merchants, and supporting their communities may yield its own rewards..."
 per_crush_house_osman_title: "Crush the Turks" 
 per_crush_house_osman_desc: "Our practice of recruiting the Shi'a Turkmen of eastern Anatolia to raid Ottoman holdings has provoked Sultan Selim to authorize the massacre of thousands of Shi'a Alevis and qizilbash across Anatolia. As the blasphemer himself marches against us, we must rally our troops and come to the defense of our brothers in faith. Let us stream through the passes of the Zagros and inflict a crushing defeat on the enemy, lest we forfeit our right to defend the righteous. Ya Ali!" 
 per_eclipse_tamerlane_title: "Eclipse Tamerlane" 
 per_eclipse_tamerlane_desc: "Amir Timur struck fear into the hearts of the world when his armies forged one of the greatest empires in history. Our conquest of Iran, Iraq, Khorasan, Transoxiana, Sham, and Egypt have created an empire surpassing Timur’s. Let the lion and sun fly above all four corners of the earth, for the felicitous light of Hazrat Ali has enlightened our rule, its brilliance shining beyond the wildest dreams of our venerable ancestors." 
 per_city_prince_lava_title: "City of Prince Lava"
 per_city_prince_lava_desc: "Lahore is a magnificent city of mosques, shrines, khanqahs, madrasas, markets, and Hindu temples pulsing with the wealth of all of Hindustan. Supporting this great city's urban development by sponsoring Sufi foundations and our own public projects will elevate it to even greater heights as Hindustan's undisputed cultural capital." 
 per_between_two_rivers_title: "Between Two Rivers" 
 per_between_two_rivers_desc: "Between the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers lie the imperial center of the famed Delhi Sultanate. Seizing the cities of Mathura, Agra, and above all - Delhi itself will aid our ambitions of conquering Hindustan while granting us access to the elite Purbia mercenaries of Bhojpur." 
 per_cultivate_artistic_talent_title: "Cultivate Artistic Talent" 
 per_cultivate_artistic_talent_desc: "The Timurid period has left Iran with a rich artistic tradition bolstered by the meticulous craftsmanship of painters, calligraphers, and artisans concentrated in the commercial workshops of Shiraz, Herat, and Tabriz. By sponsoring our own artistic workshops, we can synthesize these different traditions into a new national synthesis, inaugurating a new period of Iranian art under our generous patronage." 
 per_safavid_book_illustration_title: "Book Illumination"
 per_safavid_book_illustration_desc: "Our generous patronage of Kamal al-Din Behzad, Sultan Muhammad, and other esteemed artists of the Herat School have allowed a new generation of skilled painters to come to the fore. Reza Abbasi, Aqa Mirak, Dust Muhammad, Mir Sayyid Ali, and other notable artists sponsored by our court are producing magnificent miniatures marked by increasingly energetic compositions and a greater attention to naturalism. Continuing our patronage will elevate the prestige we have gained in fostering the rise of the emerging Isfahani school of art." 
 per_maintain_checks_balances_title: "Checks & Balances" 
 per_maintain_checks_balances_desc: "Our days as a small Sufi state of Turkmen warrior-raiders are over. The time has come to balance the demands of the estates on which the stability of our state rests. While we may never rid the state of factional infighting, we can appease the estates and ensure our place above them by strengthening institutions such as reciprocal gift-giving, tribal appeals to personal loyalty, and marrying the sons of our dynasty to the daughters of elite families."
 per_curb_qizilbash_influence_title: "Qizilbash Influence" 
 per_curb_qizilbash_influence_desc: "The Turkmen qizilbash tribes have repeatedly defied our authority by assassinating our wakils, rising in rebellion, and attempting to puppet the shah himself. We must curb their influence by empowering the non-Turkmen elements of our army and administration, particularly the emerging class of ghulam slave-soldiers and bureaucrats from the Caucasus."
 per_reform_second_pillar_title: "Reform the Second Pillar" 
 per_reform_second_pillar_desc: "As the militant Turco-Mongol nomadism that dominated the first few decades of our rule continues to dissipate, the need for a military class capable of supplanting the qizilbash grows. While the expansion of the qurchis has provided our state with an ample force loyal to the shah, the final step is to empower the ghulam slave-soldiers and bureaucrats recruited from the Caucasus. We will do so by organizing them into a standing army personally loyal to the shah while giving them powerful positions in the bureaucracy to ensure that our grip over the state remains strong."
 per_pay_the_zakat_title: "Support the Osulis" 
 per_pay_the_zakat_desc: "The recent eruption of the akbari-osuli religious controversy among Iran’s religious establishment presents a prime opportunity to subordinate the obstinate ulama to the needs of our state. Supporting the works of al-Muhaqqiq al-Karaki, who embraced the osuli principle of ijtihad (interpretation) in his defense of our state as a worldly power acting as the spiritual custodian of the Shi’a community in the absence of the Twelfth Imam may cement our claim to divinely ordained rule while giving us the spiritual authority to place the administration of waqf (religious endowments) under the supervision of the central bureaucracy." 
 per_baku_ateshgah_title: "Baku Ateshgah"
 per_baku_ateshgah_desc: "Hindu and Parsi merchants from Hindustan have established a great temple near Baku, the capital of the Shirvanshahs. We must honor this temple with a mighty atash behram to proclaim the resurgence of our faith!" 
 per_ishtar_gate_title: "Ishtar Gate" 
 per_ishtar_gate_desc: "News has reached the court that farmers have uncovered the remains of a magnificent structure near the city of Hillah. Further excavations have revealed a castle covered with brilliant blue tiles adorned with exquisite reliefs of lions and elaborate bands of floral motifs. Its distance of 12 farsang from the Taq-e Kisra of the Sassanid capital has led our historians to identify it with the legendary Kayanian king Bahram. Let us restore this monument to its former glory to link our dynasty with those of the past!" 
 per_defend_zoroastrianism_title: "Defend Zoroastrianism"
 per_defend_zoroastrianism_desc: "Now that our faith is resurgent, we will announce to the world our intention defend it by invoking the 30th line of the Warharan Yasht dedicated to the mighty Verethragna, divinity of victory: “We sacrifice unto Verethragna, made by Ahura, who makes virility, who makes death, who makes resurrection, who possesses peace, who has a free way. Unto him did the holy Zarathustra offer up a sacrifice, asking for victorious thinking, victorious doing, victorious addressing, and victorious answering.”"
 per_crowning_shah_title: "Crowning of a Shah" 
 per_crowning_shah_desc: "Our relationship with the qizilbash has historically been that of morshed-e kamel to murid (Sufi master to disciple), allowing our dynasty to command absolute obedience as both head of state and divinely-ordained universal ruler. The conquest of Tabriz has secured our status as the undisputed masters of Azerbaijan, ensuring the continued loyalty of the Rumlu, Shamlu, Takkalu, Ostajlu, and Dulkadir qizilbash tribes. Let us ride into the great citadel of the Ilkhanid imperial capital and proclaim our resolve to spread Imamiyyah and bring the rest of Iran under our rule."
 per_turkmen_tribes_title: "The Turkmen Tribes" 
 per_turkmen_tribes_desc: "The unification of Iran has cemented our status as defenders of the faith. Stories of our zealous commitment to the never-ending struggle for righteousness in the name of Hazrat Ali have attracted Turkmen Shi'a from Syria, Iraq, and Anatolia willing to die for our cause. Let us create the office of the khalifeh al-kholafa to establish a religious propaganda network to attract adherents and integrate them into the swelling ranks of the qizilbash to realize our universal ambitions." 
 per_city_holiness_title: "City of Holiness"
 per_city_holiness_desc: "The conquest of Sham has granted us the great cities of Aleppo, Damascus, Tripoli, and above all - Al-Quds, the holy city itself. Our possession of the bustling ports of Syria and the holy cities of Palestine is an important step to realizing our ambitions of controlling the lucrative East-West trade and Hajj routes to Mecca and Medina." 
 per_war_lions_title: "War of the Lions" 
 per_war_lions_desc: "The Mamluk Sultans are rich but paralyzed by factional infighting. If we are to end their pretensions to regional dominance and control the lucrative East-West trade, we must seize the bustling ports of the Delta and break their power once and for all." 
 per_sar_i_hind_title: "Sar-i Hind" 
 per_sar_i_hind_desc: "Sirhind is a well-known center of culture whose prime position on the Grand Trunk Road between Lahore and Delhi has earned it a reputation as the "gateway to Hindustan." With this in mind, its capture would let us claim the mantle of the Delhi Sultanate in our quest to conquer the riches of Hindustan." 
 per_conquer_hindustan_title: "Conquer Hindustan"
 per_conquer_hindustan_desc: "Hindustan is an incredibly wealthy land of millions dispersed across the hundreds of cities that dot its fertile fields like stars in the sky. On the eve of its conquest it is increasingly clear that it will be the jewel of our empire, and that our empire will be so much greater for having it in its crown." 
 per_into_bengal_title: "Into Bengal" 
 per_into_bengal_desc: "Bengal’s thriving ports bustling with the frenzied activity of merchants from across the world, productive workshops stirring with the hum of industry, and magnificent mosques whose halls are blessed to hear the soothing sermons of Sufi saints are a testament to its riches. Let us seize this land to strengthen our links to the lands of China, Japan, and the Malay Archipelago. The lion and sun will rise triumphant over the tiger." 
 per_build_bazaars_title: "Build the Bazaars"
 per_build_bazaars_desc: "Our cities are endowed with vast bazaars forming expansive complexes of covered streets flanked by arcades housing shops, bakeries, coffeehouses, lodges, and workshops. Supporting our merchants by building, renovating, and expanding the bazaars will help harness the wealth flowing through our land."
 per_splendid_court_title: "Splendid Court" 
 per_splendid_court_desc: "The glory of our dynasty depends on the prestige of our illustrious court. Continuing our extensive patronage of art and culture will strengthen our political authority, allowing us to accelerate our practice of converting the land of the state (mamalek) under the administration of qizilbash tribes and local notables to that of the crown (khassa)." 
 per_new_steed_title: "A New Steed" 
 per_new_steed_desc: "The strength of our army has traditionally been the tribal cavalry at our service. Let us strengthen our troops by breeding a noble steed capable of mounting the world under its mighty hooves." 
 per_sword_islam_title: "Sword of Islam" 
 per_sword_islam_desc: "The time has come to let the world know of our intention to protect the faith. While our rise to power has been anything but easy, we have risen to the occasion and triumphed over all who dare oppose us." 
 per_enforce_religious_unity_title: "Enforce Religious Unity"
 per_enforce_religious_unity_desc: "We rule a diverse realm of Shi’a, Sunni, Christians, and Jews whose foreign faiths are different from our own. If we are to guide the people towards the ever-shining light of the Mazdayasni creed, we must sow the seeds of conversion by directing the popular piety of the people toward the creation of a new religious synthesis." 
 per_subzevar_title: "Road to Sabzevar"
 per_subzevar_desc: "Along with Adar Farnbag and Adar Gushnasp, Adar Burzen-Mihr is one of the three great fires of ancient Iran. Shapur Bharuchi’s rivayat states that the Turanian king Arjasp, having killed the Kayanian king Kay Lohrasp, approached the fire to extinguish it. The fire miraculously vanished and reappeared in the Ridge of Vishtasp near Mt. Revand. Thanks to the diligent efforts of our brilliant scholars, we have miraculously found the fire near the city of Kashmar. Let us grant this great fire a temple worthy of its status!" 
 per_raise_qizilbash_title: "Raise the Qizilbash" 
 per_raise_qizilbash_desc: "Shaikh Jonayd’s time among the Turkmen tribes of eastern Anatolia during his exile at the hands of the Qara Qoyunlu has attracted a cadre of fanatically loyal adherents. Their name, meaning “red head” in Turkish, alludes to their red hats, whose twelve peaks represent allegiance to our shaikh and the Twelve Imams. Their devotion sometimes bordered on fanaticism, venerating our shaikhs as an incarnation of God and throwing themselves into battle without fear for their lives. Now that we have elevated ourselves from the status of sheikh to shah, the time has come to call on the qizilbash and rise to battle!" 
 per_land_mountains_title: "Land of Mountains"
 per_land_mountains_desc: "The mountains of Gilan, Tabarestan, and Gurgan give way to the fertile low-lying plains of the Caspian coast. This region is immensely productive and may yield great dividends in the form of profits from its silk and agriculture industries. Let us defeat the defiant northerners to bring this region under our rule!" 
 per_consolidate_persia_title: "Consolidate Persia"
 per_consolidate_persia_desc: "Decades of fighting among the Timurid princes and Turkmen padishahs have caused the people to suffer and the fields to lay fallow. Famine stalks the land as the forces of chaos and disunion reign supreme. Recent victories in light of our proclamation as the rightful rulers of Iran at Tabriz have led the people to look to us to sweep away the tyrants who have ruined the land. Let us prove ourselves the true shahs of Iran!" 
 per_city_peace_title: "City of Peace"
 per_city_peace_desc: "As the site of the burial and martyrdom of many of our holiest saints, imams, and ahl al-bayt, Iraq-e Arab is a sacred land that looms large in the Shi’a consciousness from which we draw our legitimacy. Bringing the venerable shrines of our imams under our protection will affirm our status as defenders of the faith and custodians of the Shi’a community. We must bring Najaf, Karbala, and the great city of Baghdad under our protection!" 
 per_timurid_decay_title: "Timurid Decay" 
 per_timurid_decay_desc: "News of Shah Rukh’s death has shattered the mighty Timurid Empire into pieces. While distinguished conquerors like Abu Sai’d Mirza have risen to the challenge in their bids to reunite the empire, it is increasingly clear that decades of internal strife have rendered any lasting peace impossible. We must take advantage of the Timurid princes’ precipitous decline and put an end to their rule!" 
 per_city_stone_title: "City of Stone" 
 per_city_stone_desc: "Amir Timur and his princely successors elevated Samarkand to one of the greatest cities the world had ever seen. The soaring domes and brilliant tiles of its magnificent monuments such as the Gur-e Amir, the Bibi Khanym mosque, and the Ulugh Beg madrasa will undoubtedly inspire generations of architects. Restoring these monuments to their former glory is sure to leave our mark on this glorious city." 
 per_caravanserais_title: "Caravanserais"
 per_caravanserais_desc: "Caravanserais are roadside inns for merchants and travelers. Typically taking the form of a rectangular courtyard surrounded by rooms, larger complexes can include mosques, shops, bakeries, kitchens, public baths, post offices, signal towers, and stables. While previous dynasties have left an impressive network of caravanserais, we must expand this network through an ambitious public works program to capitalize on the lucrative trade routes running through our land." 
 per_encourage_persian_poetry_title: "Encourage Persian Poetry"
 per_encourage_persian_poetry_desc: "Despite Iran's storied tradition of epic poetry stretching back to the early days of the Sassanids, our relative lack of interest in sponsoring literature has prompted the departure of poets from our country for the relatively generous patronage of the Mughal and Ottoman courts. Furthermore, the recent publication of brilliant philosophical treatises by Sheikh Bahai, Mulla Sadra, and other Illuminationist scholars of the Isfahan School of philosophy on metaphysics, existentialist cosmology, and the nature of faith have led many to question the relative dearth of literary output. We must reverse this trend and sponsor our country's poets so that our literary scene may blossom."
 per_greater_khorasan_title: "Great Khorasan"
 per_greater_khorasan_desc: "With Kerman, Birjand, and above all, the Hazrat Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad under our rule, we have opened the way to a great conquest of Khorasan. Let us put the Pearl of Khorasan to siege and strike into the heart of the dying Timurid Empire!"
 per_worthy_capital_title: "A Worthy Capital"
 per_worthy_capital_desc: "The constant factional infighting at the court in Qazvin has prompted the shah to begin preparations for the transfer of the capital to Isfahan, chosen for its proximity to the Zayanderud and vast tracts of open space. We will embark on an ambitious urban planning program to transform this regional town into a great metropolis of magnificent mosques, sprawling madrasas, bustling bazaars, opulent palaces, blooming gardens, and sweeping avenues whose glory will be equal to that of half the entire earth."
 per_spread_imamiyyah_title: "Spread the Imamiyyah"
 per_spread_imamiyyah_desc: "The unification of Iran after decades of disunion has finally lent us the spiritual and political authority to spread our faith. We come from a diverse land of Sunnis, Nizari Ismailiyyah, Naqshbandiyyah, Qadiriyyah, Hurufiyyah, Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians. We must honor our responsibility as morshed-e kamel and use the bonds that unite us to free them from their ignorance." 
 per_najf_karbala_title: "Najaf & Karbala"
 per_najf_karbala_desc: "While our custodianship of the Hazrat Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad and the Fatima Masumeh shrine in Qom has earned the admiration of our Shi’a subjects, the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala remain in the hands of heretics. Bringing them under our protection would mean that the burial place of Imam Ali, his sons Imam Husayn and Hazrat Abbas, and the site of their martyrdom are finally under Shi’a rule."
 per_unify_islam_title: "Unify Islam" 
 per_unify_islam_desc: "Glory to God, most gracious, most merciful. We have done what no Shi’a dynasty has managed to do and unify the Muslim world under the lion and sun. Our dynasty reigns supreme as the name of our illustrious shah is recited in khutbah prayers from Morocco to Malacca. Our outstanding victory has shown the world that Islam is resurgent and that we alone are suited to the task of assuming its mantle."
 per_faithful_larestan_title: "Faithful of Larestan" 
 per_faithful_larestan_desc: "Tradition states that the Prophet Zartosht urged the Kayanian king Goshtasp to search for a fire venerated by Jamshid, the fourth of the eleven Pishdadian kings. When such a fire was found in Khwarezm, it was taken to Fars where it was inaugurated as the Adur Farnbag atash behram, one of the three main fires of ancient Iran. When the Arabs conquered our land, the fire was divided in two - one kept at Karyan and the other at Fasa. While the original atash behram is long gone, let us honor its memory by inaugurating another at Karyan."
 per_iranshah_atash_behram_title: "Iranshah Atash Behram" 
 per_iranshah_atash_behram_desc: "The Parsis of Hindustan have diligently aided us in our efforts to spread the faith across Iran. With their principal religious site the great Iranshah Atash Behram at Udvada, our brothers across the Khyber have reliably helped us maintain our rites and traditions through centuries of oppression. We must return the favor by bringing them under our benevolent protection and expanding their temple to unite the Parsi and Irani communities!"
 per_passage_basra_title: "Passage to Basra"
 per_passage_basra_desc: "The mountain passes of the lands of the Kurds and Lurs provide valuable access to the fertile plains of Khuzestan. Controlling these passes would open the way to the floodplains of the Arvandrud, and beyond that - the great port of al-Basra." 
 per_fertile_crescent_title: "Fertile Crescent"
 per_fertile_crescent_desc: "The great port of al-Basra is a vital conduit for the Indian Ocean trade and pilgrimage traffic to Mecca and Medina. Constantly plagued by bandits and disease, the alluvial swamps of southern Iraq-e Arab will be difficult to bring under our control. In our quest to conquer Khuzestan and al-Basra itself, we would do well to bring the Shi’a Musha'sha'iyyah tribal confederation into the fold appointing one of our own as their leader so that they may assist us in our conquest of al-Basra." 
 per_kingdom_of_hormuz_title: "Kingdom of Hormuz"
 per_kingdom_of_hormuz_desc: "The island of Hormuz is a focal point for the shipment of goods through the Indian Ocean trade. While the rulers of Hormuz have historically placated us through regular payments of tribute, rumors that the Portuguese are casting a jealous eye on their island have made it clear that we must strike while we can and bring them under our protection."
 per_reach_arabia_felix_title: "Reach Arabia Felix"
 per_reach_arabia_felix_desc: "The disunion of Yemen is a dire threat to its Shi’a community. We must act on our responsibility as defenders of the faith by bringing our Zaidi brothers under our generous protection." 
 per_crush_asian_tribes_title: "Crush the Uzbeks" 
 per_crush_asian_tribes_desc: "Our holdings in Khorasan are far from secure. Led by Muhammad Shaybani Khan, the Uzbeks have seized Mawarannahr and are staging regular raids into our territory. Recently ousted from Samarkand, the Timurid prince Zahir al-Din Muhammad Babur has promised to mint coins and have the khutbah recited in our name if we were to assist him in reclaiming his land from the Uzbeks. Taking him up on his offer may help secure our northern frontier with the added benefit of granting us stewardship over the fabulously wealthy cities of the Land Between the Rivers." 
 per_silk_road_title: "The Silk Road" 
 per_silk_road_desc: "Our conquest of Khorasan and the distant lands of Mawarannahr has endowed with an expansive network of trade routes that could yield enormous profits if we were to harness their potential. Sponsoring the lucrative silk trade and strengthening ties with the Great Ming to improve our production techniques will make us all the more wealthy." 
 per_fund_textile_industry_title: "Fund the Textile Industry" 
 per_fund_textile_industry_desc: "The great workshops of Isfahan, Kashan, Rasht, and Yazd are famous for their textiles of brilliant color, complicated craftsmanship, and intricate design. Particularly famous are their carpets adorned with birds, clouds, trees, flowers, and geometric patterns articulated by silk and metal threads whose workmanship has attained the status of fine art. Sponsoring the textile industry by building workshops and declaring the export of silk a royal monopoly is sure to be a boon for our coffers." 
 per_ali_qapu_title: "Ali Qapu"
 per_ali_qapu_desc: "Our efforts have made the noble city of Isfahan the greatest in the world! Its magnificent maidan is unparalleled in its glory and would be made all the more great if we were to inaugurate a grand palace from which the person of the shah can project the radiant power of our state." 
 per_golden_era_title: "Golden Era of Persia"
 per_golden_era_desc: "Our generous patronage of painting, calligraphy, textiles, ceramics, architecture, urban planning, philosophy, and religious scholarship have blossomed forth into a golden age of prosperity. Coins bearing the name of our shah circulate in markets across the world as copies of our literature are printed as far as China and the land of the Franks.

We must respond to this egregious provocation with force and liberate the Masjid al-Haram!"

 per_custodians_jerusalem_desc: "The third holiest site of our faith is the Haram al-Sharif of al-Quds where God commanded Ibrahim to bind Ishaq and the Prophet Muhammad mounted the buraq and ascended to Heaven in Isra and Miraj. Now that the holy cities of Mecca, Medina, Najaf, Karbala, Mashhad, and Qom are under our hands, we must set our sights on al-Quds and bring the Haram al-Sharif under our rule!"

We must follow in the footsteps of the Kayanian king Kay Khosrow and send an expedition into the land of Turan to claim it for our faith. Once the lands of Afrasiyab are under our rule, we will commemorate our resounding victory by building a magnificent ateshgah in Khiva."

 FU_Persia_Events.1.t: "Georgian Slaves in the Persian Empire"
 FU_Persia_Events.1.d: "Conquest always brings new people into our fold. For the Georgians, honourable fighters of the Caucasus, fate devised their downfall at the hands of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. As the last of their separatist elements are quelled by various means, the question of what shall be done with their population looms above the heads of Shah [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his advisors. Many among the qizilbash suggest we have no need for unruly heathens among our administration. However, there is merit and prospective cultivation in allowing them to flourish harmoniously under our banner..." 
 FU_Persia_Events.1.a: "They will prosper in our great Empire!"
 FU_Persia_Events.1.b: "History is written by the victor!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.2.t: "Sarkhej Roza and the City of Ahmedabad" 
 FU_Persia_Events.2.d: "Originally begun by Ahmed Shah I Muzaffarid in 1411, the city of Ahmedabad was completed in 1413. Within it was Manek Chowk, the city's first square which, along with the Bhadra Fortress, were both associated with the legend of the Hindu saint Maneknath. His successors planed trees along the city's streets, adorned it with splendid buildings, and generously fostered its traders and craftsmen. \n\nThough Champaner became the Gujarat Sultanate's capital in 1484, Ahmedabad remained its superior, well-defended by its walls, well-supplied by its orchards and gardens, and embellished with well-planned streets, squares, and houses. So closely did the Sultans of Ahmedabad look after its welfare that if they heard of an empty house or shop they ordered it filled. \nAlong with its unparalleled beauty, the city is also the host of a well-known and expansive mosque, the Sarkhej Roza. \nPlanting our banner on the city's walls and using it as a center for administration will undoubtedly help us maintain our grip on the region."
 FU_Persia_Events.2.a: "A city to outshine them all!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.3.t: "Hindu Influences in the Persian Court"
 FU_Persia_Events.3.d: "War after war, we have managed what many thought was impossible. Much of the Indian subcontinent now lies safely under our grasp, and with it, scores of different people from a vast array of faiths and cultural backgrounds. Despite our zealous attention to detail and determination to maintain our identity, it has become apparent that many elements of the conquered Indian people have made its way in the most private crevices of our uniformity. Thus, we find ourselves at a crossroads, one that may determine the history of our great nation as we know it." 
 FU_Persia_Events.3.a: "It's time to embrace our new identity!"
 FU_Persia_Events.3.b: "We could never abandon our roots!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.4.t: "Military Reforms of Shah $MONARCH$"
 FU_Persia_Events.4.d: "From the moment of his accession, Shah [Root.Monarch.GetName] realized that he must impose his authority on the qizilbash or remain their tool. The qizilbash, however, were still the backbone of the military strength of our state; meaning that if he weakened them, he undermined the state. \n\nConsequently, Shah [Root.Monarch.GetName] embarked on a number of internal reforms designed to break the power of the Qizilbash. He did so by creating substitute military and administrative elites. He raised the profile of the ghulam institution, swelling their ranks with thousands of Georgians, Armenians, and Circassians taken captive during the brutal wars in the Caucasus. \n\nHe to form a new standing army composed of recruits from the ranks of the ghulaman-e khassa-ye sharifa (crown servants). The ghulams were largely Georgian, Armenian, and Circassian Christians taken prisoner during the $DYNASTY$ campaigns in the Caucasus (though a small number of Georgian nobles had voluntarily joined the $DYNASTY$ army), converted to our faith, and trained for service in the royal household or administration, akin to the role and function of the Janissaries in the Ottoman Empire." 
 FU_Persia_Events.4.a: "We must fund the qurchis."
 FU_Persia_Events.4.b: "Expand the use of muskets for our cavalry corps."
 FU_Persia_Events.4.c: "Let us use the Zamburak, instead!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.5.t: "Religious Affairs of Shah $MONARCH$" 
 FU_Persia_Events.5.d: "With the unification of Iran, many voices in our court and the upper echelons of the ulama are in heated debate regarding the direction of our religious loyalties. Some suggest we remain true to the word of the teachings of Islam while many tear their coats in support of Zoroastrianism." 
 FU_Persia_Events.5.a: "Our nation lays firmly with Islam!"
 FU_Persia_Events.5.b: "We must embrace Zoroastrianism!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.7.t: "Armenian Slaves in the Persian Empire"
 FU_Persia_Events.7.d: "Conquest always brings new people into our fold. For the Armenians, honourable fighters of the Caucasus, fate devised their downfall at the hands of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. As the last of their separatist elements are quelled by various means, the question of what shall be done with their population looms above the heads of Shah [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his advisors. Many among the qizilbash suggest we have no need for unruly heathens among our administration. However, there is merit and prospective cultivation in allowing them to flourish harmoniously under our banner..." 
 FU_Persia_Events.7.a: "Allow their flow into our society!"
 FU_Persia_Events.7.b: "We can't water down our superior caste."
 
 FU_Persia_Events.8.t: "Victory in Chaldiran" 
 FU_Persia_Events.8.d: "The Battle of Chaldiran took place in [GetYear] and ended with a decisive Persian victory over the Ottoman Empire. As a result, the Persians annexed much of Eastern Anatolia and northern Iraq from the Ottomans. It marked the first Persian expansion into the depths of Anatolia (beyond any previous borders) and the end of Ottoman expansion to the east. Chaldiran was just the beginning of several decades of destructive war, which ended only with the Treaty of Isfahan. The battle and consequent war marked the end of Ottoman rule in Anatolia, and exposed both the decadence of the Sublime Porte's corruption and the incompetence of the Ottoman administration."

 FU_Persia_Events.10.d: "After the downfall of the White Sheep Confederation, many of their fighters roamed around the barren countryside looting and harassing travelling merchants and farmers. Men without purpose, whose hearts were full of faith and loyalty to their former masters, are now rudderless in a world that's changing faster than them, leaving them behind. To these men we must raise our banner, and grow the seed of our faith in their heart. Let us call onto these battle-hardened men of the plains and have them lead our armies into greatness!"

 FU_Persia_Events.14.d: "Merchants from all over China, Borneo, and the Isles of Malaya ship their goods through the shores of Ayutthaya and into the Bengal Delta, the first point of entry into Indian markets. Consequently, the Sultans of Bengal were able to profit greatly from intercontinental trade, building in their stead a grand empire that proved a significant adversary to our armies in their conquests of India.

As our royal servants enter the shah's palace, they bow their head, eloquently informing [Root.Monarch.GetName] that the process nears completion, and that the results are surely to be an improvement over the existing breed of cavalry in use by our ghulams and qizilbash."

Despite the man's brilliance in all matters of state, be it conquest wherein he led his armies as far as the doors of the Rus, be it matters of administration wherein he ruled a vast empire with impressive elegance, or be it the sponsorship of arts wherein he funded artists, poets, and architects, none of his sucessors held even a spark of the fire of this great man's brilliance. As a result, his line has ended with the final remnants of his homeland falling apart before the might of our grand armies. A new day for Khorasan and the people formely under Timurid rule!"

 FU_Persia_Events.18.d: "Since the humble beginnings of his rule, Jamshid al-Kashi’s letters to Ulugh Beg’s father noted that Ulugh Beg’s visit to the Maragha Observatory had an effect on him, imparting the idea of his very own observatory in Samarkand. The Ulugh Beg Observatory was completed sometime around 1422, with the monarch inviting over skilled astronomers and mathematicians to help build it. Among those he invited were Ghiyath al-Din, Jamshid al-Kashi, Mansur ibn Muin al-Din al-Kashi, Salah al-Din Qadi Zada Rumi, and Ali Qushiji. Over 60 mathematicians and astronomers would work at the observatory, with al-Kashi appointed as the first director of what would become a significant house of knowledge where astronomers and mathematicians would work together in finding new discoveries."

 FU_Persia_Events.19.t: "Royal Poetry in $DYNASTY$ Persia" 
 FU_Persia_Events.19.d: "While initially overshadowed by Arabic liturate during the Umayyad and early Abbasid caliphates, New Persian soon became the literary language of Central and West Asia. The rebirth of Persian in its new form is often accredited to the generation of poets exemplified by Ferdowsi, Unsuri, Daqiqi, and Rudaki, who used pre-Islamic identities as a conduit to revive the stories of Sassanid Iran.\n\nWorks of the early era of Persian poetry were characterized by strong court patronage and an extravagance of panegyrics. Khorasani style, whose followers were mostly associated with Greater Khorasan, is characterized by its supercilious diction, dignified tone, and relatively literate language. \n\nHowever, the more recent Indian style of Persian poetry (sometimes called the Safavi or Isfahani style) took over. This style has its roots in the Timurid era and produced the likes of Amir Khosrow Dehlavi and Bhai Nand Lal "Goya"."

With it, we have gained access to lucrative trade routes criscrossing the coasts of Farsistan and the waterways beyond the Pirate Coast and Persian Gulf. But, with great coin comes great responsibility, and our treasurers warn against overindulging ourselves in our newly-found wealth. \n\n§GTrade, much like a relationship with a spouse or the growing of a beautiful tree, needs to be cultivated, taken care of, in order to grow and assist us in prospering for the rest of our earthly lives§!"

 FU_Persia_Events.21.d: "Lucrative trade, exotic goods, and valuable spices have been flowing through the straits of Hormuz for centuries. Oftentimes, these merchants would be raided by slaver captains, sea dogs out to rob the common folk of their goods. In order to crack down on these outlaws, we should decide on how to approach the situation, given the delicate situation the straits are in right now."

 FU_Persia_Events.22.d: "Success brings wealth, and wealth often comes with prestige, legitimacy and power. To that end, many of our adventurous merchants have travelled to and from the legendary palaces of the Great Ming, returning to our courts and markets with many strange, foreign, but breathtakingly beautiful textiles and materials. Among them, blue-and-white porcelain reserved for the King of Kings as a personal gift by the Emperor of China himself. This porcelain will surely adorn our tombs and palaces, granting us an air of legitimacy and newfound standing!"
 FU_Persia_Events.22.a: "A material worthy of the King of Kings"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.23.t: "Architecture of the $DYNASTY$ Period"
 FU_Persia_Events.23.d: "The grandeur of Persian architecture is beginning to grip our nation. New innovations in religious, secular, palatial, and landscape architecture are beginning to take hold. Meanwhile, state-sponsored artists under the particular aegis of Shah Tahmasp have created a brilliant synthesis of Iran’s various styles; thought it nonetheless remained a court rather than national style. Under his successors, the art emanating from our cultural capitals spread across the empire, branding Iran as one of the world's leading melting pots of architecture and the arts."
 FU_Persia_Events.23.a: "Our nation's history, written in stone..."
 
 FU_Persia_Events.24.t: "Imamzadeh Harun-e Velayat"
 FU_Persia_Events.24.d: "The architectural masterpiece of the early $DYNASTY$ period is the portal of the Imamzadeh Harun-e Velayat in Isfahan, erected around the year [GetYear]. Its patron, Grand Vizier Durmish Khan, is mentioned in a Persian distich over the door. These poetic inscriptions, infrequent in previous buildings, quickly became characteristic of $DYNASTY$ buildings. \nThe complex is curious for its exterior, which falls short of the portal. Attention is given to the exterior facade rather than the internal layout, an amphasis frequently repeated in later $DYNASTY$ buildings. The building is conceived as a frame for lavish decoration rather than as an entity in which each element has its party to play; hence its unassuming design."
 FU_Persia_Events.24.a: "Such a diverse range of styles befits the King of Kings!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.25.t: "Ali Mosque"
 FU_Persia_Events.25.d: "Isfahan's Ali Mosque is a four-iwan mosque with a large domed sanctuary and distinctive exterior facade. The sanctuary provides an instructive link between the earlier architecture of the Blue Mosque of Tabriz and the later Mosque of Shaikh Lotfollah. With its numerous arched bays opening at the ground and gallery level, it resembles the earlier building. But the square ground plan and use of four massive pendentives carrying the dome looks ahead to the latter. \nThese pendentives are identical in size and contour to the arches along the main axes. Net vaulting fills the intervening spaces, and a thick circular inscription band completes the transition to the dome. The handsome, spacious proportions of this mosque and its bold reworking of the traditional domed square formula popular among Persian architects makes it a formally outstanding period."
 FU_Persia_Events.25.a: "Beauty and devotion worthy of God!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.26.t: "Tomb of Amin al-Din Jibrail"
 FU_Persia_Events.26.d: "The tomb of Amin al-Din Jibrail is one of the first fruits of the $DYNASTY$ Shahs' uninterrupted interest in the Sheikh Safi al-Din khanqah and shrine ensemble at Ardabil, who clearly saw the complex and its dependences as a dynastic shrine. Its form owes a great debt to the domed squares of Timurid Transoxiana, notably the mosque of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi and the Gur-e Amir. Its form is still transitional, not least in the lack of integration between its internal and external layout. The high-drummed dome is set abruptly, without intermediary, on a square, flat-roofed lower story whose box-like appearance is redeemed by the deep axial arched portals. Mausolea such as this would soon replace the classic "tomb tower" favored by earlier architects, offering a far more spacious layout encouraging large-scale pilgrimages." 
 FU_Persia_Events.26.a: "A dynastic shrine to remind us of our roots!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.27.t: "Jannat-sara Mosque" 
 FU_Persia_Events.27.d: "The Jannat-Sara mosque is one of the grandest examples of $DYNASTY$ architecture at the Sheikh Safi al-Din complex in Ardabil, representing a generous effort on the part of the shah for the Ardabil shrine's sanctity and place of honor among Iran's monuments. \nInternally, the plan retains its octagonal shape on both stories; each side is occupied by a blind arch enclosing narrow arched niches superposed on one another. \nRather than discouraging access by a forbidding blank wall, the architect has chosen to invite entry into the building through deep bays. The psychological effect produced by this arrangement is fairly different from earlier tombs. Though hints of this approach can be found in earlier buildings, it had never been expressed on this grand a scale." 
 FU_Persia_Events.27.a: "Let our faith shine the path to victory and divinity!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.28.t: "Abbas I - Persia's Greatest Emperor" 
 FU_Persia_Events.28.d: "Abbas I, one of our nation's greatest monarchs, came to prominence with his ascension to the Persian throne in [GetYear]. Not one to waste time or leave the state's matters in the hands of viziers and advisors, his plans of grand reforms and the reduction of estate influence in the court were merely the beginning of one of the most enlightened reigns of our time."
 FU_Persia_Events.28.a: "The throne is his!" 
 FU_Persia_Events.28.b: "We could never abandon the status quo."
 
 FU_Persia_Events.29.t: "Abbas I's Expansion of Isfahan" 
 FU_Persia_Events.29.d: "One must turn to Isfahan to assess Shah Abbas as a patron of architecture. Abbas' succession completely transformed the sorry state of affairs which had prevailed in Iranian architecture for nearly a century, with the dynamism with which the new shah sponsored the expansion of Isfahan inspiring architects to recover the inspiration that had trickled away in the long stagnation of previous reigns. Appropriately enough, Timurid and not early $DYNASTY$ architecture provided the springboard for fresh developments, among which the monuments of Isfahan claim pride of place."
 FU_Persia_Events.29.a: "A magnificent wonder of architecture and urbanism!" 

 FU_Persia_Events.30.t: "Gardens of Chahar Bagh"
 FU_Persia_Events.30.d: "Do you like Shah Abbas I? His early reign was a little too absolutist for my taste. But when his reforms came out in 1593, I think he really came into his own, militarily and administratively. His whole reign has a clear, crisp growth, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives Shah Abbas a big boost. He's been compared to Mehmet II, but I think Abbas has a far more bitter, hands-on approach on administration. \n\nIn [GetYear], Abbas constructed this; the Gardens of Chahar Bagh, one of his most accomplished projects. I think his undisputed masterpiece is Naqsh-e Jahan Square. A square so awe-inspiring, most people probably don't look at its beauty. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of ducats and the importance of trade. It's also a personal statement about the Iranian Architecture itself." 
 FU_Persia_Events.30.a: "Such remarkable beauty!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.31.t: "Naqsh-e Jahan Square"
 FU_Persia_Events.31.d: "The Chahar Bagh and Naqsh-e Jahan square were the key features of Abbas' expansion of Isfahan, providing a framework within which subsequent buildings would be fitted. Much of their importance depended on their size, with the square measuring 512 by 159 meters - larger than mostly comparable European plazas.\n\nIts apparent size is magnificent by its low-lying buildings, fronted by a low two-story arcade defining its limits. The buildings accessed by the arcade are primarily functional; shops occupy the first floor while dwellings occupy the second. Their lowness has the further aesthetic impact of exalting the stature of the four buildings that break through the facade; the Shah Mosque, the Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, the Ali Qapu Palace, and the entrance portal of the Qeysarie Bazaar.\n\nShah Abbas completed the square by adding a monumental portal at the center of each side, granting access to the four aforementioned buildings. With these portals, the square could be interpreted as a gigantic version of the classic four-iwan courtyard which, found in mosques, madrasas, houses, and caravanserais, maintained so tenacious a hold on the imagination of Iranian architects.\nNone of these buildings intruded onto the main central space, whose vast emptiness allowed the square to play a varied role in the life of the city. In turn marketplace, military training and parade ground, execution dock, polo pitch, open-air stage, running track, and arena for animal combats, it was a magnificently illuminated funfair by night and the inevitable center for all kinds of royal entertainments. Its legendary reputation earned it the name by which it is known today; Image of the World." 
 FU_Persia_Events.31.a: "Come one, come all!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.32.t: "Shah Mosque"
 FU_Persia_Events.32.d: "Renowned for its quality of serenity and confident marshalling of large spaces, the Shah Mosque is one of Iran's most famous $DYNASTY$ monuments. Its construction, the work of Ustad 'Ali Akbar al-Isfahani under the direction of Muhibb 'Ali Kika Lala spanned some twenty years. Measuring 52 meters (some 14 meters above the inner dome), no other Persian mosque has a double dome so high. Its broad court, measuring some 70 meters across, was enthusiastically copied by Qajar architects. All these extra requirements were prodigal of space, which accounts for the mosque's huge area of some 140 by 130 meters at its greatest extent. \nThough the mosque's four-iwan plan ostensibly accords with the classical tradition of Persian Islamic architecture, variations of the familiar schema meet the eye at every turn. The east and west iwans lead to domed chambers, a layout customarily reserved for the qibla side alone. Minarets crown both the portal and qibla iwan. \nPerhaps the most unexpected addition, however, is the pair of custom-built madrasas flanking the sanctuary complex. Identical in form, they exhibit the same urge for symmetry that marks the rest of the mosque, giving it an exterior as streamlined as the interior layout." 
 FU_Persia_Events.32.a: "The most prestigious Persian mosque with a double dome!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.33.t: "Madrasa-e Khan" 
 FU_Persia_Events.33.d: "Built by a certain Husain Sama'i, the Madrasa-e Khan in Shiraz is perhaps the most interesting $DYNASTY$ madrasa. Some of its details, like the fine stonecutting of its walls, stone-carved dragons, and the distinctive tilework of its vestibule show signs of a highly original local style. Meanwhile, its sheer size provides ample evidence that the emphasis for monumentality which so often recurds in the building of Isfahan was by no means confined to the capital or royal foundations. \nWhile the building employs a standard four-iwan plan, the general lack of symmetry within this framework is marked. Only the north and south sides share similarities in their two stories of student cells. \nThe plan's communal areas, including the vaulted apsidal iwan, are to the east rather than the usual qibla side or entrance complex. Moreover, the madrasa has no separate mosque as the southwest iwan perpendicular to the entrance fulfills this function." 
 FU_Persia_Events.33.a: "A curious blend of embellished architecture, piety, and education."
 
 FU_Persia_Events.34.t: "Chehel Sotoun"
 FU_Persia_Events.34.d: "Owing to its idyllic garden ambience, the Chehel Sotoun is one of the most famous Persian palaces. Like many other $DYNASTY$ palaces, the Chehel Sotoun has a deliberately unstable and impermanent air. Thus, some flavor of the festive, hedonistic lifestyle celebrated there still lingers. \nIts eighteen pillars, seeming as thin as matchsticks, seem preposterously inadequate to bear the burden of the apparently massive flat roof. The name, Forty Columns, refers to the reflection of these columns in the water, is surely a reflection of the picturesque fantasy the palace offers. \nLike the Ali Qapu, however, this palace offers an aspect of four-square solidity from its sides and rear, which is in marked contrast from its frail and insubstantial facade. In contrast to the main facade, the rear wall presents a solid mass of masonry from which the principal break is the rear entrance. Despite it trabeated form, it owes more to Sassanid palaces than any other traceable source, for the deep recessed central bay leading to the throne room operates like a Sassanid iwan." 
 FU_Persia_Events.34.a: "Regality and decorum!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.35.t: "The Shah's Academy" 
 FU_Persia_Events.35.d: "The Madar-e Shah madrasa, caravanserai, and bazaar is an unexpected return to the grandiose planning of Shah Abbas, representing the principal achievement of $DYNASTY$ architecture after the 1630s. \n\nIts merits lie in the serene, almost rational disposition of the three constituent units. The madrasa and caravanserai are oriented along the same eastward axis, marked by the entrance portal of the madrasa and continued in the pools of both buildings, which extend even to the stables closing off the complex at the west end. A pathway and pool divide the courtyard into four miniature gardens, perhaps intended as a peaceful echo of the wider Chahar Bagh outside. To the north, the bazaar knits together the two larger buildings. It comprises a single broad corridor some 220 meters in length symmetrically bordered by multiple arcades on both sides. \n\nThe scale is impressive and the planning is rational and meticulous to the last detail. The confident marshalling of such large forms would be a heritage bequeathed to the later Zand and Qajar architects, and is arguable the greatest strength of Persian architecture in post-$DYNASTY$ times." 
 FU_Persia_Events.35.a: "Royal education shines through the study of Iranian scripture!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.36.t: "$DYNASTY$ Wall Painting Under Abbas I"
 FU_Persia_Events.36.d: "The $DYNASTY$ period has left a legacy of wall painting incomparably richer than the sum total which survives from previous periods. The Chehel Sotoun and Ali Qapu palaces host ambitious figural schemes preserved in much of their original splendour. They show an almost total dependence on the repertoire of contemporary book illumination, with its emphasis on intimate courtly scenes and occasional (frankly erotic) flavor. \n\nAt Ali Qapu, for instance, the artists declined to exploit the varied wall surface available to them, preferring to reproduce on a larger scale the rectangular frames of book illumination. As a result, the palace becomes what amounts to a picture gallery, an impression strengthened by the eye-level height of these artificial panels and the deliberately muted floral or other non-figural motifs which fill the intervening spaces. Thus, this interstitial decoration operates as a kind of wallpaper." 
 FU_Persia_Events.36.a: "Such breathtaking compositional changes!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.37.t: "Shahnameh of $MONARCH$"
 FU_Persia_Events.37.d: "Shortly after his glorious accession, [Root.Monarch.GetName] ordered the creation of a royal Shahnameh. The production of this great book of 759 pages and 258 paintings by the leading masters of the Shah's library was to continue for the next two decades. Its pages reflect the development of painting during the early part of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s reign, as a manuscript as large as the Shahnameh utilizes the skills of a wide range of painters, calligraphers, and artistic directors. Particularly famous are the folios by the esteemed painter Sultan Muhammad, whose work shows the emergence of a measured synthesis of Behzadian reason and Turkmen energy. With its meticulous detail, unparalleled draftsmanship, energetic composition, and brilliant colors, Sultan Muhammad's famous rendering of the Court of Gayumars was given special praise, for it was regarded as the zenith of $DYNASTY$ painting, for the hearts of the boldest painters were grieved, and they hung their head in shame before it."
 FU_Persia_Events.37.a: "The zenith of Persian culture and fine art!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.38.t: "Rise of the Persian Arquebus"
 FU_Persia_Events.38.d: "During our many campaigns, the rules of warfare have changed time and again. Our forefathers used to conduct their wars on horseback, carrying swords and bows. The advent of gunpower, however, has redefined the way we carry out the eradication of our enemies. As it happens, our troops have not only adopted the arguebus, a long newly-invented rifle, but have gone as far as to integrate into their cultural traditions and everyday lives. As a result, our infantry and cavalrymen have made a name for themselves on the battlefield."
 FU_Persia_Events.38.a: "Our skill with the arquebus is unsurpassed!"
 
 FU_Persia_Events.39.t: "The Arrival of the Shirley Brothers"
 FU_Persia_Events.39.d: "War brings together the unlikeliest of people. As fate would have it, none other than Sir Robert Shirley, along with his brother, Anthony, travelled the globe in order to reach our court. Their mission is to spread the military expertise of Europe's most fearsome armies and bring our two nations closer against common enemies. \n\nRobert Shirley was the third son of Sir Thomas Shirley of Wiston, Sussex, and Anne Kempe, the daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe of Olantigh in Wye, Kent. His military insight made strides in regards to reforming and retraining the Persian artillery. Most of all, Sir Shirley and his sibling shall be a deciding factor in the modernization of our armed forces against all those who seek our destruction."
